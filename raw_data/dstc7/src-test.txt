I'm working on porting an older version of Erlang onto Ubuntu 10.04 (needed to ensure our software works correctly). From my research it looks like I can use dget to download the source package from 8.04 on my 10.04 machine and then build it there.

[SEP] you mean a firewall as an router where I can open ports etc?..when I think of firewall I always think of something like windows firewall which I can stop but I haven't seen anything like that on ubuntu :O [SEP] well I mean both actually. there are also firewalls on ubuntu, could you check the output of 'service ufw status' [SEP] ufw start/running [SEP] ok so you do have a firewall running [SEP] oh hehe :O so I should stop ufw? [SEP] either you stop it, or you allow connection on port 25, via "sudo ufw allow 25" [SEP] ah yeah thats better ..but do I really need a connection on port 25 on my machine if I only want to use relay-smtp?. @  * [SEP] yes your machine will still be seen as a mail server from any client connecting to it, and you will need to allow smtp connections to it [SEP] aha oki then I get it  but still after allowing port 25 and trying to telnet localhost 25 I get the same error message while running nullmailer [SEP] is the nullmailer service running ?

Not sure where to ask this. Just bought a micro usb cable for use as a data cable for my phone. Turns out that it is a charging cable only. Damn sales rep lied to me when asked about it.

[SEP] other than google (or maybe even the ubuntu forums) no. I think the only difference would be that the data cable has more copper connections than the charging one, so I would assume you just add a few. But then Im sucking my thumb.

When I hold either shift button or CTRL button and try to use my mouse to select multiple items in a list (in all applications), the mouse will freeze until i release the shift or CTRL key.

Anyone know of a gnome-shell extension that makes the search in overview function more like gnome-do?. If the kernel is almost "rolling stable", then the DRI libraries should be as well... [SEP] not a gs extension no, but if you want to go that route, why not install an omnilauncher like synapse or albert etc. straight-away? [SEP] well I got gnome-do now - albert I haven't tried. Does it have an equivilant in OS X? Because I feel like I remember that name... [SEP] you might be mixing that with alfred, i don't know OS X to tell whether they're related :).  synapse is in the repo's, for albert you'll need a PPA --> [URL] [SEP] ooo - I always like to try out new things :D THat's why I'm running Ubuntu 17.04 now. I'm kind of impressed that Ubuntu is probably the only distro that currently supports flatpaks, snaps and appimages...

I'd like to advocate Linux to common users, but one big barrier to entry is the complexity of actually obtaining software....  if snaps, flatpaks and appimages run stable, across the board, you could choose any distro you'd want, and get your third party apps directly from the vendors website :D. At least that's what I'm hoping....  craaaaap... mono -.- [SEP] you need stereo? [SEP] no, I mean alfred - it downloaded a crapton of mono dependencies.  cus like a genius I downloaded Alfred and not Albert xD. g'doy [SEP] ah wait, i hate mono myself, you might get away with the --no-recommends switch when installing, let me check.  lol [SEP] this os x app had a similar name, like a typical name of a buttler. So I thought "alfred"....  ...which would be a better name... I'm Batman~!.  o - qt5 :P [SEP] only some qt dependencies yes [SEP] yeah, but that's fine. qt5 is actually quite slim and nimble, if utilized correctly.  kind of disappointed that I couldn't run commands with arguments... though that maybe a plugin, I guess [SEP] i just noticed i get 'albert' from [URL] PPA, has a newer version
