does it have everything I need to format a partition ext2?. and ext3?
yep
yay I can use it to install gentoo. !
lol. LOL
=-). brb rebooting into ubuntu
form last week:. 04:21:47] <findme> this is a big crowd here. [04:21:53] <findme> have all gentoo users moved here ?
to bad its still using apt I would switch in a heart beat if it had its own package manager
what are you missing in apt ?
ok. why'd think that? i currently dont have any p2p servers of any kind open.  as i know of..
well its not really a normal port... and i dont normaly see those kind of port numbers unless it p2p traffic or a server or sime kind.  what was the port again?
I get half the fps in Tremelous compared to Windows
do I have to do something similiar. ?
edit /etc/X11/[URL]nf. replace ati with fglrx. restart x. I don't know the command but there is probally one
brb
sudo apt-get install kalarm failed. o.o q.q
which version of ubuntu are you running?
9.10. Yeah, I saw that, doing it now.
kalarm is in the karmic repos
can it also be set up as a router for my home network?
i think so tho I havn't done that
aaron: are you connected via WIFI or cable?
wifi
aaron: have you tried with a cable?
no access to cable
aaron: ebay... ?. aaron: what router do you have?
lol.....let me clarify. No access to router to make a cable connection.  I can get a cable, just cant get to the router
aaron: it is your router?
Motorola SURFboard SB5101E.  yup ypu
aaron: are you setting your IP address manually?
nope, all auto.
aaron: or how about doing a factory reset of the router?. aaron: sorry, you dont have access to router...
lol....yeah, thats a no go
okay ill try  thanks. by the way  even if i restarted the machine, the application still do exist
Not really an area common for this operating system or linux to be honest, my guess is cleaning the browser, and temps etc will work.
okay  ill try..thanks for the info
If you are running a derivative in root, that is a whole different matter.
it's just a simple cout<<"hello world". however, when i try to execute the binary, it says it's not there =/
cout<<"hello world" is not a complete program. You need to just pastebin because I am not behind you.
just worked. with wep too
gonna buy it then ....  still have to do wep using iwconfig ??
i set it up when i installed
thanks
encrypted home. mmm wait, why is swap mentioned there?
and you've reformatted it using whatever you need to reformat it to encrypt it and use it with your newly installed (and presumably encrypted) home?
I alread had my home encrypted, I just reinstalled ubuntu 14.10
I don't knwo how home encryption works, so it might be fine, or it might the root of your problems
yes nobody answered, not really the time of day
looks the same here..  try asking again after some time, if possible.
Yes.
fix /etc/fstab then
because I could have sworn I just upgraded. lsb-release lies!. I'd stack my reputation as a 28 year old slacker on it!. stake. fuck. oops
there are some known upgrade misinformation bugs w/ natty, but afaik lsb_release has been pretty ok
thanks, I am coming to terms with being on 10.04
here's an easy way to tell: from the terminal: dpkg -l | grep software-center and see which version you have
uh package conflict.
output?
Konversation and Kformula cant be installed at same time
well.. have you tried it paste this line on google? :).  is that WHOLE output?? (btw are you on gnome and want kde? :) )
: where?
on my keyboard, next to f12
Cedega is more for games... last time i ran cedega lol it screwed my OS
lol
Yup and all are 00
then turn em up
Yup
or hit the 'm' key to unmute
Still not working. All are already 00
zero is zero. which card do you have selected?
Should it be MM or 00?. The thing is. It's working in the log in screen\
00 then use the directional keys to turn them up
When I log in my ubuntu account. The sound is not working anymore
is there a AutoMute in there?
All of them are maxed out and 00. Yup
disable automute
Done. Still no sounds
should be sharp now
The volume button is not even working
you running pulse and alsa?
let me try.  oh wait what do you mean by wrapper function
you have to write '...' by yourself :).  ln is binary, if you define function in context of your shell, it will be used instead. hm, there should be `else env ln' not to have infinite recursion :b
no go for me.. allot of people are having the same issue as i
it's been a while though. might have broken since, I haven't checked lately.  does it work from CLI or konqueror or something?
i have a second HDD in my pc, i got from a friend who put with XP some stuff on for me
- sudo fdisk -l what does that say?
ye.
and the web site is a public one ?
yes.  the two computers cant be simultaneously in the PC. You have to remove the ethernet cable from one and plug it to the other, to work.
redirect the web site to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file - works for the Mac as well, if it runs OSX.  muh ?
if I change my /etc/hosts, it will have effect in the mac pc as well? :/
the Mac also has an etc/hosts file, if it runs OSX
it does.. Isnt there a way to do it in this pc, and have effect to the other too? Like from the modem page (192.168.1.1)?
no
yes how do i unmount to check??
umount /dev/<device node here>
how do i know what i am mounted in
mount
can u tell me from this what i need to type [URL]
First, I don't even know what you're trying to do and why
every time i have installed a different iso disk and choose erase and use entire harddrive i keep have less and less hard drive space its like 2 gigs are dissappearing each time
Have you tried manual mode and erase the partition then create a new one?
I must start my deamon before I'm logged in, and it's not in that menu.  is there a misc init script?. nite613, alias
you can use cron. I don't know about init
well, I want it on boot, and I'd like it to just go when my network runlevel starts
sorry that is beyond my knowledge :/
:/ ty
ask again being more specific with what you need to do and someone will help if they can
is that some lame reccomendation for mutt?. yeah I'm using a gui emailer and I'll switch to mutt right away
a very bad joke. Thunderbird does that if it cant find the mailserver
um, yeah..  but not completely. Only for the things you upgrade. Unless you don't give that an argument. in which case yes
if you dist-upgrade, it'll upgrade everthing it can. that's the whole point.
SEjeff, i can put songs on my ipod through rhythmbox?
No, but I got gtkpod to work perfectly with my nano and breezy
shorewall?
it's a firewall app
thing is i want to rout the internet to a ethernet over usb device (Sharp Zaurus SL5500)
hmm.........
It's a external USB drive....  Any ideas?
what cd-rom do you have??
An external LG USB
sry didnt see your answer, please write my name so i see it
ok doen that.  what now my home folder has open
move to where the NTFS drives are mounted, you should have permission to access ( read )
yeah but i want to have acsees from my desktop. it will let rout have acsess but not my log on
then in the terminal try chown NTFSfoldername usergroup:username
? lol
My group's James, and my username's james, so I'd put chown /home/james/Desktop/NTFS/ james:james
but it works for non-X-window apps, like wget..  tested now: simple command echo "text" > text.txt works OK in cron. The problem is only with displaying X-window apps. Running, not only displaying (if it's possible) - pgrep can't find them.
sorry can not help you there. :(
it doesn't answer anything in dapper...
well, wait until Dapper is released.
are those terminal commands?
yes.  space bar to scroll forward, b to scroll backward, q to exit
error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory). this is from a root terminal.. the config directory doesn't even exist, though :\. i get a similar error when trying to build a .deb
you might need a python-dev package -- just a moment.  install the python-dev package ('sudo aptitude install python-dev')
ok I'll try it. it's installing 2 packages.. any reason to use aptitude and not dpkg or apt-get? :)
i think aptitude keeps a log file, and is a bit smarter about installing/removing packages
also, any idea if i should install using python, or use it to build a .deb and install from that?. i see
if you know how, I'd build a deb. Should make uninstallation (and maybe upgrading) easier
there are instructions on how to build in the unix-installation.readme.txt file, so i guess you would recommend then using aptitude to install the .deb by sudo aptitude install [URL]b ? :)
no, aptitude is for installing from repositories. Use dpkg to install .deb files
*nod* i wouldn't be surprised to see that show up eventually. altho ... i'm not sure how good of an idea that is .... theoretically one can burn flash sticks in seconds if something goes wrong
what format would be convenient for both linux/windows users
i tried edgy. what's the difference?
feisty is the current development release, but if nothing else is working for you, at least seeing if feisty does work may help you troubleshoot your problem
does that do dj like things?
like what
same with xubuntu, arch locks up on lspci. 17.10 insta freezed when trying to use xorg based de. lspci also locks up this tty
when i use the term or phrase "other distributions" ideally something that absolves canonical.  but i understand
yeah, I'm pretty sure the issue is with polling lspci generally, as it's the same issue on ubuntu tty, and arch term. this may not really be exactly ubuntu specific, but it's the distro I want and am viewing the issue through, hope it's ok to ask here
let's pretend that you found out the exact same "symptom(s)" occur in centOS,fedora,suse,redhat,debian,linuxmint. That would suggest your symptoms are NOT specific to any disto
some background: I had 16.04 working perfectly until I installed bumblebee and added a line to grub kernel options. This killed the install. Current issues are attempts at reinstalls.  yes, agreed
and that your symptom(s) appear to stay isolated to the hardware pc.
they do indeed. my dualboot in to windows is available and working without issue. Last night I was randomly able to get the 17.1 live cd working and installed, but ran in to the issues with X I mentioned. I presume that was thanks to wayland just keeping the problem at bay though, rather than anything working correctly
sadly most users will instinctively try to avoid doing any steps to trouble shoot to isolate their complaints or symoptoms
am willing to jump through as many hoops as possible. required* :P
saying your symptom(s) do not occur in windows isn't as useful or valid as you think on the surface. It's whats called a "apples vs oranges" comparison.....in short you can't compare them...they are two different things.  that's why i specifically asked if you had observed your symptoms occur in other "linux" distributions
yeah I know, just trying to give as much context as I can
apples vs apples. oranges vs oranges
I'm not a particularly advanced troubeshooter re: this kind of issue
you don't need to be an advanced trouble shooter...i started this off pretend that you found out your symptoms were NOT specific to any distro to kinda not only to get you mentally engaged in trouble shooting but to also make a demarcation point
consider me mentally prepared
start downloading some other linux distro iso file
what should i search for?
so do a search in synaptic for smp and install the kernel relevant to your architecture.  are you using an x86 processor? like a p4 or core2 duo?
i was wondering what is going on.....  is it the same issues i have. i am getting ocassional freeze-ups when skype is trying to do something....: the entire system locks up for close to a minute....anyone expeirience this.
Do you find when Skype tries to access the sound hardware after a period of inactivity, it locks the machine at a deep level for between 30 seconds and 5 minutes
yes that is it
I've found mention of it online, but no answers yet :/
so it is STILL an ALSA issue. ?
It seems to be a kernel issue of some kind
right
[URL]
apparently, its seeing three1.  but sblive is showing to aplay as snd card 0
can you disable onboard sound thorugh your mobo?
erm, thats a good question
hang on a sec, I just wenth thorugh something similar myself.
[URL]
search in the softwarecenter for "wmv" and there choose "gstreamer ffmpeg..."
126. mp
you mean 128mb?
yes
the xubuntu live cd can run with 128mb.  at least xubuntu 6.06 does
RPM or BIN?
bin.  rpm is usually for suse
do I have to install from Konsole?
yes but its easy
yeah, I made it executible, but it gave an error in the file manager...
download it. make it executable (chmod +x [URL]le). and start it sudo ./[URL]le
why doesn't Can. allow these updates anyway?
sorry. which updates you mean?
yes.  I upgraded from hoary.  any idea?
can you access the mounted disk from the command line?.  in a terminal change to the mounted directory and see if it shows you your files
im quite shocked, (well not really since that is what i usually get on irc) that noone seem to have answers for the most basic questions one would encounter in an os.
: what is your issue please?
installed lxqt, after reboot black screen
: if you press CTRL + ALT + T do you get a terminal?.  : if you log in as a new user is it the same?
i cant log in at all. black screen.
: so no lightdm shows or did you enable auto login?
thanks I'll check them out
skallen, maybe you need to log out and back in
so i just remove the whole folder or just its subfolders? I was a bit confused because there are two subfolders info and files
I never tried just deleting .Trash-1000... I go through the folders until I find the files themselves, or their parent directories, and just erase those.
hmm, my .Trash-1000 is already about 8.8 gb.  deleting each file by hand might be a bit of work.  do you thing its save to just delete the contents of info and files?
What do you see in .Trash-1000/files?
hundreds of files
Ctrl+A and hit Delete
what about the info folder?
How big is the folder?
.Trash-1000/files is 8.8 gb and .Trash-1000/info is 6mb. it seems to be some kind of meta data folder. because all the files there have the same nam. name
Sooo erase everything in /files and see if /info empties automatically.  Any luck?
yeah files are gone now
Great. It's weird that it doesn't ask to clear the trash on that partition when you unmount the partition... it's what the storage partition on my HD, and now my portable hard drive, do.
hmm, it gets mounted at boot time with fstab
And the trashed files generally show up in my Trash directory regardless of the device.
hmm.  yeah thats strange. i also just saw that i have 20 broken file in the info directory and im unable to delete them.  they look like this on the terminal: -????????? ? ? ? ? ? [URL]ashinfo
Strange. When I delete a file from /files the relevant files in /info gets deleted too.
im going to boot xp and run chkdsk
k
yes
esc key
huh
hold esc key while booting
mine won't do that. it says can't find plugin
=\
I have c930e logitec . I dont have drivers though
i guess good lighting and a good GIMP for post. minus 'good' gimp is good
driver to set frames and hdz
you could try an app like cheese
that for snap and video. not for Herds adjustment. frequency
i'm not sure what that means but you could try with ffmpeg or gstreamer
cam auto adjust, frequency etc are things for which drivers are needed
gstream-launch is it? create your own pipeline.  i guess so yeah
those are not the tasks of cheese of ffmpeg.  cannot adjust focus with cheese
i'm guessing the camera has autofocus
yes. it seems not good at pictures with details
guvcview might offer some more options if it's still available in the repos
thx.  its showing my front cam. Not the one I us in usb
that's even worse. unless it's got an option to choose the device
thanks
How do I install a kernel module to be automatically loaded?
what am i looking for?
disabling eth0 at boot
I have my HP LaserJet 4050 installed and set-up, shared too but windows users seem to be unable to reach it. Unfortunately I have no second linux machine to test if it is an OS compatibility issue
ah ok, what are you using to share it?
I just want to understand what's the use of init=/bin/bash as a kernel parameter
It should not be necessary, but instead as part of the PATH
sorrry I didn't understand you, there are lots of books and docs that tell you to troubleshoot booting issues by editing grub and use init=/bin/bash
I need to know the issue you think fixes this. I need the source problem.. s/fixes this/this fixes/
ostotogari: that may be ~/.config/deluge
@ Your right, its located in .config/deluge
Yeah, I thought so, but I wanted to have a taste of it. :) I suppose I'll have to wait then.
do you have msttcorefonts installed?
Yes
if so you might want to try to remove them.  I assume you already went into firefox preferences and playes those font settings..yes?
Oh, really. Can you explain why ? To be clear it's not just the web pages that are not anti-aliased but the whole interface. It seems it doesn't use Gnome subpixel smoothing settings..  Yes, I did.
mm some of the reports I have read on this issues at times point to the mscorefonts as a possible problem with no specifics so far.  but I am also doing a search on the issue
Ok, thanks, I'll try to remove them.
how did you install firefox 4?
I think it's a known bug in earlier versions of FF and ubuntu..  Just downloaded the archive on Mozilla
you might want to try one of the PPA;s for this [URL]
yeah, just did that.
you beat me to it
is that what i type in.  okay tanks
sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
Yeah, it's detected. I'd just like for a graphical, easy to use interface (if you're going to suggest using a file manager)
if u use the phone as a mass storage device..u can use rhythmbox to drag n drop as well..
cheers
I'm getting some I/O errors. When I boot my machine up it says my drive isin't ATAPI compatable. Does that mean I need to use a 40-pin cable and not an 80-pin?
slart did u chhange channels at all?. heh
as far as I can recall I used it as a regular TV.. changing channels etc...  I don't remember what kind of drivers I used though.. this was a year or two ago
:|. slart thanks anyways
you're welcome
oh i see. is there anyway i can set alltray to autostart when i boot my machine?
"startup applications" in "preferences"
but how do i tell alltray to start evolution though?
try it
try what?
use the application, stir and shake, then ask more questions
i know what i could do! does alltray remember what it docks to tray so then i could just have alltray start.
use it and **find out**
I dunno, taking advantage of better CPUs does bring advantages. CPUs have come a long way in the past 15 years. or whatever it is. 20?!. wow
I've lost the url, but it has already been shown that the differences are not spectacular.  (not as much as a gentoo fanatic would believe)
what do you mean?
you start a new x server for playing your game. that way you can switch between $DE and your game with ctrl+alt+f6/f7 or something and you won't see anything from the $DE in your game
filezilla?. where can i get that?
quad3d-dbi: lynx, links2, dillo, epiphany, etc
I want to execute rtorrent from 12 to 3 for example, when the computer is always connected and I need it on shell not X.  perfect. then: cron
both anacron and cron suck equally for things that need a GUI (X), they're both really for background tasks that don't involve user input
but it works with no X programs, And I don't see them working, they are on the background?. for example: can I tell cron to execute rtorrent or irssi ?
using screen, probably
hardware specs. lspci?
you can look what has been detected....dmesg
oh dmesg printed out a lot.. :-(
dmesg|less
the startup text on the splash screen
!usplash
i am useing the startup-manager for the splash screen will that mess any thing up?
[URL]
no but unity still looked better. i mean just look at the top bar. its so...jarring. the menu integrated into top bar looked so slick :/. no its just a jarring mess...firefox means three huge ugly bars stacked. and the gray color doesn't even 'flow'. guys...its making me physically ill. God I hate mark shuttleworth. the whole unity 8 hoopla
ive been using blackbox and e17 for years now, never looked back
God. whats e17 a desktop env?
[URL] i have it since its very early release and was using it on old p4 box. at the time gnome and other envs were really slow for that computer - e17 was running great
looks like elementary os. maybe theyre using this.... not bad at all.
anyway, how to force cron.d to run without waiting ?
so anyway I can't imagine any reason for this monstrosity....compared to this even windows 10 looks like the pinnacle of harmony
yeah even kde looks good compared to gnome ;p
[URL]
'sudo apt-get clean ; sudo apt-get install -f ; sudo apt-get update
Tried that. Didn't work. :-\
is there a new error?
Nope. Same error.
try : sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*.  try : sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*
YEAH. err. yeah
actually i never seen 2 Ethernet having same HW address !
thanks. So if I created a .sh file that would have execute permissions? Or does it apply to every file?
no, it doesn't decide whether a file should be executable or not based on the file-extension.  shell scripts doesn't need to be executable, you can always run them with: bash the_script.sh
my internal partition.  can I pm you?
sure
where is settings->engine? I can't find it
settings->amarok settings->engine tab
all it has is xine, no other engines listed
not under engines, but under output device, select esd or alsa
ok, then you're using unity. So, open the file manager, and double click on the image
i did it with unxz. :(. i cant do it with double click. . :(
Why, do you see any error messages?
no errormessage
What happens when you double click on it?
strange GUI is shown
Is it this program? [URL] This is the "zip for linux", it's called file-roller and it's preinstalled and it can uncompress xz files
no
Upload a screenshot then. !screenshot
i cant because i did it with unxz. :(
it fails to extract files about 30-50% of the time i try to use it. I'm just sick of using it. I want something that is stable
never failed once for me..
Yes, they are. Microsoft Habu Gaming Mouse + Locitech G15
are they on the same port (via a hub), or something?.  or, is the mouse wireless?
i did that already. my issue is that i can't boot to the partition now
what partition? i'm saying ubuntu install media
i've already installed ubuntu using a flash drive. the issue is that i can't get to the installation
right but did you remove rEFIt yet?
no i'll do that
hold left alt after the boot chime then see what boot options you get.
Thanks  .... do we have git irc group here ??
there are many channels here on freenode.. !alis |
thank's i will give it a go.
np
how do you mean?
/ nevermind I was aiming someone else
grub tells me, it can't get the filesystem type
booting on Win partitions?
nods
:/. i doubt theres much you can do unless you can filter it out using yur amp settings. get a basic soundblaster pci, theyre like <unconvertable> 1 these days
just a really bizarre situation. Brand new motherboard.
its quite common with onboard sound. check your cabling too i guess, make sure its not too close to the puter
no....  could it be somehting wrong with the file permissions?
that file shouldnt just go missing. something went very wrong.  hmmm, if you changed permissions, possibly
do you know how?
these are the settings for mine: -r--r----- 1 root root 724 Jul 6 2013 sudoers. use the command: ls -al
@ can u give example. how do i move sample.txt
how to copy things in msdos is not the right place to ask im afraid. this is an ubuntu hcanne. channel.  but xcopy sample.txt a: should work. or just copy (the xcopy command came in windows dos i thing)
what?. thats not a tutorial
I know, but if you run the application jockey-gtk it will search for aditional driver sofrware, (if needed)..  Is it not working at all?.  What is the issue with it?
i have an mx 440 what video driver do i need to install? I installed nvidia-173. but its not being used for some reason
Where did you get nvidia-173?
from ubuntu's repos. the x-swat one
ls /etc/X11/[URL]nf #Is it there?.  Have you restarted the Xserver since installing it?
so you already know how to do it
if I had any belief that reporting a bug would result in a fix, I would surely report a bug..  all I see are people arguing for two years after which the issue is then closed by some automated system.
well you have a 10% success rate for reporting bugs, and 0% chance complaining here will work so... probably go with reporting bugs
nah, I will just get rid of Ubuntu once I have the time for that. I already moved the rest of my systems.
63Mb of swap used?.  is there anyway to keep swap from being used? I've heard that it can slow performance.
yes, you can tell swap to be used less.. look here [URL]
thanks pally :3
right now my box has 154MB of swap used.. which is normal after i hibernate/suspend a few times
this box is my Linode VPS :) we never hibernate/suspend it heh
doesn't mean swap shouldn't be used though. i was giving my case scenero
Nekow42: I'm following the instructions here: [URL] but I'm having problems on the ndiswrapper step.
good luck..... i have one of those, so if you get it to work, let me know
you were able to follow the entire guide?
i have not tried
hmm. switche doff the keyboard there. will see if that works #next time i log in
ok, if that doesn't work, have a look in your startup applications: system > preferences > startup applications
your all instructions assume i'm using GNOME..  i'm on unity
*sigh* your questions assume (but i need to get updated, still using 10.10 ;)
well precise is just around the corner :)
hehe, i'm stubborn. i still run 5.04 (hoary) on an old vaio laptop
whoa !
oh yea, i figured out my last question above; you can close specific windows using wmctrl -c NAME :)
oh so easy. thanks. how can I query apt-get for part of a package name? I want to install mysql but don't know exactly what the package is called
apt-cache search mysql
sweet. wierd.. I don't see mysql server listed in the results
just type mysql
found it.. thanks
I see mysql-server and mysql-common

i just joined it and there are hundreds of people in there
but i added multiverse to the 2nd line after universe, with a blank in between
and did you do an apt-get update ?
yeah. -thanks btw for your help
why just the second line? you mean just the deb-src line?
oh i see
make sure you did the same for the deb line too
k
then apt-get update. then you should see it
it is either that or barely audible. the only parameter that changes the hiss is the microhone boost
try lower micro boost and speed louder, that's all I can suggest ;)

Hi , I have a serious issue with ubuntu 14.04 LTS.My system is not loading ubuntu , as i power on the system it displays "reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in the selected boot device and press a key ". <larsN> Nothing is connected to the CPU.
then if you're trying to install Ubuntu, you'll need to make boot media (either optical, or USB) and select the right key combination to choos that boot media (many times it's F12)

sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter sudo modprobe bcm43xx okok thnx!!. thnx
you should be gtg any luck?
my card was working but it randomly turns off, so i'll have to wait to see
you are using fiesty right?
yes
the normal driver is bugged or something. don't know the why, but thats the how of it' good luck
i want to convert it.
mencoder seems to be able to do it.  [URL] explains some stuff, seems sensible
ok how do in stall the dvd-decoder then? No just Add/Remove... ?
opps getting mixed up. <unconvertable>  [URL] , follow the instructions for "Install libdvdcss2 and w32 video codecs in Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron)". <unconvertable>  mplayer is installed by default
haven't had any problem?
Nope.
how did you proceed? I've tryied everything I think
I made sure I had all of the correct codecs.
true
u are already better
ty
yw. lets code something together
VLC will play wma ?
hmmm, not unless you compile in the WMA patch
where do i get vlc and how do i compile in the patch?
you can get it off the home page ;). DRM is a nasty nasty standard. DRM is curtailing our rights, that's what
- i don't get it.. why?
because it's a private address range.
- how should i do a vnc port fwd to another pc?
are you trying to do it over the internet ?
- no, only within lan
is it on the same 192.168 network
- yes :)
show me the rule again please.
ah, thanks didn't think of that. trying now
mine dosent work either
same thing, I get ubuntu splash but then a lot of text scroll by and I end up with (initramfs) prompt
how did you make this startup disc?
with ubuntu startup disk creator and a downloaded .iso from [URL]
how many disk do you have on your computer?
only one internal, its a laptop
how many partitions are on it?
three partitions on an extended and one primary (or what it's called)
I need to know what error the live system is giving you, can you take a screen shot or rsync dmessage to someplace you can pastebin..  erm 'dmesg' i mean
what it says is "mount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory" and same thing but with /sys and /proc. And: "Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init".  that is just above (initramfs) prompt
that is an error message yeah... but thats being caused by something else thats happening earlier
I'll try to get a dmesg out of it
can you get to the shell on the livesystem?
nope, but dmesg worked also with initramfs prompt
ahh then you can get to a shell..  can you ping google or 8.8.8.8
not sure how to save the output from dmesg on the usb..  yes it's a simpler shell I guess.  no ping command
first mount the usb somewhere "mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt' then 'dmesg > /mnt/output'
I doubt it
Right click on the Gaim icon, and be sure you didn't check the Mute Sounds button.
my speakers are unmuted, and I enabled them.  there is no check there
alright, I don't know then. That was my only idea. :P
that gave me"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games. ".  so i need to put it in usr/bin?
yeah that'd work, sorry i didn't read your question properly the first time, to make it executable you need to put a #! /usr/bin/python at the beginning of the script and make it executable with chmod
just the loopback. If I run an ifconfig I see all interfaces I should have (eth0, 1 and 2.
are you using network manager to manage your network interfaces? and what are your interfaces?
Apparently 8.10 doesn't like when you manually edit the network config. Found that out the hard way and started using the network manager GUI..  yes. Eth0, eth1 and eth2.
no, the network manager is just finiky, I usually uninstall it right off the bat :).  all three are ethernet connections?
But as I said... soon as I reboot, I get a second eth2 under the network manager..  Yes
does ifconfig show the extra eth2?
this is for LAMP, just how is this off topic
You are not asking about lamp you are asking about tutorials.. there is a diff'
everything's ready in Ubuntu, just need to play *.m4a encoded with iTunes and I can't... other solution would be converting them, but that might be as interesting as ripping it all again
i was kinda reading about PyMusique the other day...
googling it
Apple tried to shut it down and sucessfully did.. for about a day. Then PyMusique came out with another to one-up Apple. I dont think Apple's shut that down yet
PyMusique's website won't open...
won't for me either.
a quote from Dvd Jon "It is somewhat interesting from a DMCA/EUCD perspective. The iTunes Music Store actually sells songs without DRM. While iTunes adds DRM to your purchases, PyMusique does not.".  the guy's a pain in the ass for the whole Big Business cartel :p Am not forgiving myself for not have known about it before!
so you're just tryin to get Ubuntu to read *.m4a, correct?.  I agree.. he's been a hassle for Apple
yeah.  plus he's the Dvd ripping guy. Not only for Apple :)
haha, true.. there isnt a AAC decoder for linux?
yes, faac. it's installed
*.m4a is AAC.. right?
this is ubuntu server, so no GUI
select server united stated from Download from?. you would need to change server
no, it's on the gb archive
then update at terminal if you like
it was the downloadable shell thing from Nvidia. thing is, I cant compile the current one, complained about symbol mismatches.. hence why I started playing around with my kernel headers etc. and noticed I was not on a SMP kernel anymore
oh, ok. since it seems you want to use the latest version of the driver (and not the older in the repos) then you it would be better to use Envy.
is that the fancy nvidia installer thing?
yes, it will download the driver from nvidia and install it for you
I will try that
but remember, everytime time there's an kernel update you will lose your desktop
hmm :).  I think I used sudo incorrectly.. how can I log in as a normal user using sudo?
if you are root. use exit to un-sudo
sure but how can I change to be some user using sudo?
michaeljones, theres dozens of iso burning tools in the repos..  i use su, to switch to a differnt user.. !burn
thats a problem. it doesnt start
whats the error message
it shows error wrong architecture i386. i have a core 2 duo. x64 system. maybe thats why
look out for a verion for ur architecture
Yes, I'm told it will work, following instructions at https://ubuntu-[URL]munity/t/ubuntu-mate-1510-powerpc/2506/4
When are you seeing the kernel choice, on the mini it is just a link to a net install.
It is using the text installation screens, this is the "Install the base system" screen. I am getting six different kernel selections. I can list them if you like.
I'm just trying to remember what that may be, in a imagebin or pastebin if text yeah.
ok. thanks
I assume you know what to put there
thanks
ATI's 3d tech comes from when they bought FireGL
how do i do that flannel?
tabman: that last comment was for you too. Sorry .
Popey, i don't think it's those issues, i have got past the acpi and pnp bits
no, the pata_cs5535 is the issue where it cant find the disk.  bug 318805 is what you're seeing
ahh, ok. i will go read more, ta
no problem  i filed that bug, and you're the second today to ask about it :)
any suggestions on replacement?
i usually just mount/browse with Places, works better that way
no im not
and yes it is a irc exploit not sure if it's only mirc
hm oke kinda sucks damn script kiddies
yup that exploit doesnt seem to affect Xchat though. least not on my end
yeah...?
./the_beast : Permission denied
ok, what about /home
If it is on it's own partition and you select expert partitioning to manually do it, sure.  That is how I do it
\me cheers
the other way around /me ...
hald. hal daemon. Hardware Acceess Layor daemon
rcconf
let me try
or, /etc/init.d/hald start
I am trying to compress a dvd iso in 2 files. I had been looking all over the internet but don't find nothing about that
doesn't matter what you're trying to compress
may you guide me with that
honestly, i haven't used that feature, except once or twice on windows, but that was years ago. you could try googling it
got no idea
ok.. i guess i just have to wait for somone at the forum to post then :( .. my server will be down i guess.. heh.. :-/
either that or upgrade to breezy like I have :)
that is a sollution.. but what happens to my old system then? will i keep all my settings?
should do.  if you reinstall you won't.  unless its on a separate partition
dang... then i need this to work.. heh.. i have made sooo many settings..
i see it there, kill -9 <pid> isn't working.  i tried to kill the pid next to it's pid
sudo?
lol :)

nope, still there
do 'which rhythmbox'
In kate my inbuilt terminal dont work.
unless you add 3rd party repos (not recommended)
i got the problem that i have accidently chosen a screensaver that kills my xserver. and now i cant change it because even the preview in the screensaver-menu kills the xserver :/
oh yeah, my 3D doesn't work so I have disabled screensavers altogether... I found this [URL]
this has been happening for 3 weeks or so ;)
hmm.  not maybe a proxy problem?
if it is, then it's my ISP's invisible proxy, and there's not a lot i can do about it :(
hmm. maybe mv some files in /var/cache/apt somewhere else, and retry (this is a wild guess ;)
could i try cleaning the cache?
'cleaning' as in?.  as in 'apt-get clean' ?
I've checked there, I don't see any option to disable icons.
you need just to disable icons?
Yes.
why?. I don't think there is an option like that in ubuntu..  what you can due is remove or move the /usr/share/icons folder.. that might due it.. ;-) I haven't tried Ubuntu 8.10 yet, will due soon... nice to see whats new.
check the log files.  to check the log files
That's pretty vague. Does it say which log file?
then why is it messing up with me
I'm lucky?
i dont know
there's the wireless key, and there's gnome-keyring that stores the saved wireless-key.  you can 'apt-get install gnome-keyring-manager' to play around with your saved passwords.  deleting the stored password using gnome-keyring-manager should have the desired effect
thanks =)
np's :)
ops.. I think it shows only the passwords for WEP and WPA
indeed, you can delete the entire keyring if you want
but i need to delete the nm-applet 's key.  i hope i could make myself understandable
gnome-keyring stores nm-applet's key.  hehe, I think I get it - the nm-applet key is stored in gnome-keyring, when you login it's gnome-keyring asking you for the keyring password
yes i think that one is correct
I'm not sure if you can setup a keyring without a password, I guess you could delete the entire keyring, logout/login again and try?
there are 2 keyrings here, one for a wireless network called "asus_router" and one called "benq".  do you want me to delete both?
those are both keys :) the keyring is what they're stored in
ewww hang on
that may well be the 'default' keyring.  in which case, see if you can change/remove the password from within gnome-keyring-manager :/
if you have ntfsprogs installed, gparted should be able to. see: [URL] for a start reference
cyD: thanks
Hah. THanks. I've been highlighting it all this time
you have to accept it because its non-free and a special licence is used
<> but most of distro already have have that
Ubuntu is different.  Here updates only install patches, new versions of packages are in complete-distro-updates
<> u mean dist-upgarde. ?
Yes
i added an extra service which starts perfectly... once ubuntu loads if I restart the dependent service it starts perfect every time but during boot this doesnt work.... that was @
what i was going to suggest is throwing a sleep command in, if you were using startup applications, but i dont think thats what your looking for
the issue is exactly this... this is a mythtv pvr and one of my sources relies on extra software to work. ive scripted the start up of that and added it into start up. this works perfectly however the mythbackend is starting before the decoding software has initalised meaning it doesnt pick up all sources untill I manually restart it after linux loads...
is the startup script for the backend in /etc/rc2.d ?
yes its in rc2.d S99 - I changed it
and whats your script, as s99 will run first
I dont even know what twinview is
edit [URL]nf. and do Option Twinview "disable". I think. h/o let me check
K i'll give it a peek.  The word "twin" doesn't exist in my xorg
Option "DynamicTwinView" "False"
Oh i know what it may be, i updated my gfx driver
that's the xorg command
IIRC, i changed my gfx driver to fglxr (or whatever)
once I disabled it it fixed my resolution/refresh rate probs. do you have an ATI card?. obviously so
this it not an option, as it breaks reverse compatibility
then you can't
no set option or so?
readline interprets the quotes
It doesn't seem to be detecting. normally in windows, there is a light that lights up in the front that shows when it scans, then it turns solid when it connects, right now its not on
run "dmesg | grep ipw21", does it print anything?
no
is there a button to enable it or something?
not quite, meaning it is possible thou?
How would your computer know to look for it there.  You can mount the updates and install that way, but to reformat your system and install it must be via CDROM
scusa ma mi puoi dire come si fa?
ma come si fa che?
Interesting..  Thanks.
i set up a [URL]o in my /boot/ partition as a 'rescue if all else fails' entry in grub..  unetbootin can also do a 'live cd' type install to a hard drive partition. you could then boot from and install to a different hd/partitions (i think)
really i hate unity and Love ubuntu 10.10 and just wondering is there any possibility to disable the distro upgrade reminders
I have no idea how to stop it .. guys any suggestion how to stop the auto upgrade
what will this do?
That module contains all the cutting edge wireless drivers for Ubuntu Karmic from the testing repositories which havent yet been officially released, hope it could help
ok i will install that is there something i must do after i install that?
not really, just Open up <unconvertable> Software Sources <unconvertable> and browse to the Updates tab, make sure the karmic-backports option is ticked
i have only ssh :( just apt-get update and upgrade?
:( you'll have to enable that locally(I mean you'll need to do that on the computer that is having that wireless problem)
nvidia 8800.
Manday: Hmm, that should handle video pretty good. I don't have any experience with 64bit flash, so that may be an issue with it. Try turning compiz on or off, I've often noticed a difference between the two.
i believe ive deleted an important line in mine yes.  just need the orignial file to see what i might have removed
reinstalling the package will work.  check /usr/share/postfix/
ahh thank you
!language
chesney: thanks
sure thing.
aeolus 6800, nivida based gpu. im stuck on the dos-like window
well, you better work on networking first. so at least you can get online.  are you using wireless?
I've looked at it and I have some questions it didn't answer
its off topic here. dont they have a channel?
_ yeah
all have unique IP addresses and mac addresses too
yeah they have unique ip address and Mac
weird indeed
ofcourse all AP are using one channel e.g:6
is that because you are using WDS ?
what is WDS?
nevermind, that answers that. its wireless distribution service
I don't know about kernel updates, do the happen often ? manually ?
there are probably a half-dozen to a dozen updates every 6 months. unless you have a reason you cant use grub you should use grub
Yep@.  yeah.
did you try to install the drivers from the ati site?
It was working fine.. I just tried to make the tv-out work.. And screwed it up.. Now when it boots, I don't get --anything-- but a white screen.. Not logos, not text, no nothing.
ok, hit ctl-alt-f2 , you should get a console
Just white screen.. Nope.. Does nothing.
ok, boot in recovery mode, and try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , and then exit.
How do I get into recovery mode?
when you boot, hit escape when you see something about grub. There'll be a menu
any other way using synaptic
no man, it stores everything in ram. just burn a new cd
no. I did a little moving around and such though. I guess, in a way, that probably counts as recreating swap. Plus I've played around with other distros that reformatted the swap. What can I do?
are you sure its still sda3?
thanks! I'll check those out.
the first 2 are KDE-based, so they will install extra KDE/Qt libraries if you're using GNOME, I believe.
:p
will install those (only install them if you need them0
i heard that it will break your system and its safer to backup and just format and install
I would do that as a preference
yes how far it can pickup ssid's
'kismet' will tell you signal strength in (db) for all ssids it sniffs
can you right click on my name in a way that brings up any kind of contextual menu?
yeah. private chat. n=teacher@199.80.154.68
does that not work? Sorry, This is my first day with IRC
yeah it make a seperate channel. you got gaim
would a firewall do anything?
i dont know. maybe the router
and I am assuming you have send messages that direction? (channel)
n=teacher@199.80.154.68
how i can see it?
Since you have the name of the package, just use synaptic package manager. Google it if it's not there to find out if you need to add another repository.
about 312mb mem, 490mb or something swap
ok, the standard rule is to have 2xmem as swap
what command should i be using to safely resize my partitions?.  a gui tool would be nice if one's available
boot from the live cd. and use the gnome partition editor.  never tried it myself, be carefull :P
oh cool
(the equivalent of "complete removal" vs "remove" in synaptic)
i think something went wrong, how could it take this long
up to you I guess, cancel and start over
yes..but i am not getting the correct result.  log shows erro 0*0001
can you paste your crontab on http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
well, /proc/cpuinfo only detects one core :(
You need a SMP kernel.  Does uname -a say "SMP" anywhere?.  If not install linux-amd64-k8-smp
:)) dropbox :))
web store?
sorry?. could you rephrase please. didnt get the question
do you know, what is FTP?
yes.. file sharing system.. oldie stuff.. no security blablabla
hmmmm, it is not file sharing :D.  it hasnt be file sharing
Tried that
lspci lists them?
Yep
so what do you mean "work" then? what is the card?
thanks a lot
np. you can customize gdm theme
It not specific to linux, its the dvd drive itself :(. It kinda just gradualy got worse.
Hmm. What are the symptoms?
Make wierd noises, and doesnt relly read the disc properly.
bad noises are bad..  it can't be too old though right?
i can't get to /etc/group to edit it unless i'm root
"sudo -i" will give you a root shell
I tried but the VPN connection gets greyed out after I've added it
pptp, openvpn or ?
openvpn. [URL] and my internet connection works since I can browse the web
so you installed openvpn client and network-manager-openvpn , and received a username and pw from the vpn service , correct ?
yes but the problem is that my network manager can't detect my network device even though I can browse the web. _, and I use a VPS
open a terminal , run sudo dhclient eth0, if you're using ethernet
it says "cannot find device eth0"
well , dunno much about vps , so i guess I can't help much , . BBL ...stuff to for a while
you know where the wine channel is? there's noone in #wine
!wine
pretty sure, In the print settings i have chosen my printer and the GIMP-PRINT driver.
i was thinking if CUPS is using the rght driver ?
How do you mean? :)
Common UNIX Printing System <- it's where the stuff is sent before it's sent to your printer
would that just be cp <filename> /media/<user>/disk ?
yes
Thanks . I'm apparently just an idiot. Forgot sudo
usually its set to use dhcp. if you want to change that edit the /etc/network/interfaces
kvm_intel. .  kvm_intel
sudo modprobe -r kvm_intl
that works but i would like to automate the proccess
definitely, but when you do that it's not loaded right?
yes it unloads the driver, i have added it to [URL]nf but after reboot still loads .....  any ideas?
are you using qemu?
qemu ? i guess not
okay that's fine. it manually loads that driver because it needs it..  did you run "sudo update-initramfs -u" after blacklisting the file?
yes
it should be blacklisted then... you blacklisted it in /etc/modprobe.d ?
yes /etc/modprobe.d/[URL]nf.  thats what i thought too
hmm i don't know what to say. it should be blacklisted..  there could be another program that loads it.
ok maybe some kind of lacky bug or so
do you have qemu installed? check. i know it loads it
ok. now what
it is a kind of obvious menu system give it a shot
yes.  hopefully this is a one-time file edit or something
if you open nautilus, file->connect to server->browse network. this doesn't do what you want?
yes and no ... it asks me for a password to access.  but i never set one ... i tried my own username password, my router password ... nothing works. it asks for my username and pass
install ssh, sudo apt-get install ssh on both machines
then what?.  i dont want to have to use the terminal every time i want to access my files on another machine
then you will be able to browse via nautilus over ssh
/jail for now. But jk_init already looks for the files when copying the binaries to the jail. I had the same propblem with the [URL]i config file, but the location of that file can be specified with the -c option, which works. But now I have the same problem with [URL]i
given the chance ubutun will cache your entire disk. look at the buffers section and you'll see that its just keeping a lot of stuff cached..  well the binary may have some hardcoded path set at runtime where it looks for the config files?. can you just give it the right path as an argument?
maybe, but how can I fix it?
if your program cant find the config file it probably has a command line option where you can explicitly tell ti the location of the config file?
yes, that is what I said. The normal config file can be specified with the -c option, and that works. But now it failed because it couldn't find another file (which is also a config file I guess, but not the main one)
ah, did you give a prefix when configuring the file, or maybe there is a path in the main config file, or an environmental variable that it sues. *uses
no I didn't give a prefix, and by default the prefix is /usr. And somehow it looks for the file in /usr instead of /etc
it looks in /usr/etc/jailstuff?
. could you explain it?
it's a font thing, I'm assuming (bad line drawing?)
same thing
reboot
Hello. Do you remember me?. from last night/day
yeah
i cant connect to my home server
okay ...
[URL]renity-irc,net 6667
you have to be more specific than that.  what is the problem
I don't think so trying to use it with anything right now i have installed cheese and it says no camera, but specifically i want to use it with teamviewer
okay. do me a favor: pastebin me the output of the commands (in terminal) of: lspci and lsusb.  type the command: lspci; lsusb
I turned all those up and still nothing.
soundcard?
ok. wait a sec. @ here it is: Linux Jag-Laptop 2.6.28-15-generic #49-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 18 18:40:08 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux
ok 32bit should be ok
what is that ? :) not to literate with all ubuntu specific names :(
try running this script.. it test some stuff for compiz [URL]  hehe.. it's an opengl demo thingy.. some twisting gears in a window
give me a mom, connecting :)
it's just a quick test to see if your video stuff is setup right
ok so just follow on with the commands thats it ?
did glxgears work?. !canonical
gears show fine.  the module just says that it encountered an error checking the memory size, all other things say ok
then try the script from the webpage.. there are instructions there
i already ran that :) thats where the memory error showed up
hmm.. hang on.. let me check something
sure :) im just tryin to figure out what is causin this, because i just had to run recovery and fix some consistency issues (my whole desktop was locked up ( ).  ok i installed nvidia-settings now, and it says all tests [ok]
hmm.. so all settings are ok.. and it's still not working?
nope:(.  all problems started 3 days ago out of nothing
might have been a kernel update.. don't remember when the last one was.  what kind of graphics card?
5200fx
that's an ati card, right?
nvidia
ah.. ok.  you're using the nvidia drivers from the restricted drivers?
yes
and you just get the "Couldn't enable desktop effects" errorbox?
no just nothing works, even that it is checked in hte ccsm
have you enabled the desktop effects before trying the change the settings?.  in system, preference, appearance
that starts gdm too
startx reads your .xinitrc if xinitrc starts gdm then edit xinitrc
thank you!.  there's no .xinitrc on my system, only xinitrc @ /etc/X11/xinit
then its reading the system one then
and where is it?
you just wrote it
ah goodie....  have you got a link t an Xorg bug central?
nope....  I'll check with daniels tone later ;-)
my color dept....  what you sayd is not funny from my point of view, because im fed up with ubuntu for weeks, my system does nothing then crash and then i NEED to reboot, and nobody can help me
I answered your question... that is your color depth.
member:identifier:hinhin: am using it but not sure how it works
in that case... would the graphical installer be easier for you?
i can't get the ppc gui to load at all.
ah no wonder
I think it's not configured well for my graphics card
hmm... what you want to do, is create a new partition from the free space.  if the live CD graphical installer isn't working... there may be a good chance that it still won't work after installation...
that is a worry. some how it set the Hz beyond my moniters capabilitys
ah don't worry about that :P... nowadays monitors won't let software force them into doing something like that
basicly I'm hoping i can borrow an old vga crt.  my flat screen isn't flexible enough.
what mac are you using?
g4 tower
i found a few good sites for OSX/ubuntu 7.10 dualbooting
origional relise (with the dvi interface).  anyway. I was wonering. I have this HFS+ partition with space but I'm not sure how to set the partioner to make a new partition out of the free space with out screwing up the data in the HFS+ partition.
as far as i know... it won't touch the data, only separate the free space
so i would select the option? resize the partition?
yup resize
Only One primary HDD
you using uefi?
It doesnt detect any drives in legacy, It's running in uefi Yes
most system have a boot menu if you hit f11 or whatever key before it boots. see if there are other choices to boot in the menu
I've entered the bios, switched between legacy and uefi, disabled secure boot, no other choices as I see, made sure the HDD is first on the boot order as well
thats not what I said
sorry, f11 towards bios? or towards booting from a usb
towards bios, if i take you meaning
I understand. boot menu, yes.  I have - try ubuntu gnome without installing, install ubuntu gnome, OEM install for manufactureres. check disc for defects
that sounds like booting from the cd or usb. *that sounds like the installer when booting from the cd or usb
flaneel that sounds dumb, why ubuntu+1 for any mention of the latest ubuntu release?
because it's not released yet..  that is the dapper channel ;)
where repository?. what
!info openshot
super?
super is the orginal name for the "windows" key
ohh:) thanks
no problem
and the cube?.  I enabled this things because i was curious how they work:)
well you first have to go into ccsm general options Desktop size tab.  horizontal virtual size = 4 the other two settings = 1.  then be sure the Desktop cube Rotate cube and viewport switcher plugins are enabled.  also click on the rotate cube plugn and push up the "zoom" slider to about half way.  then either middle click and move mouse around on desktop to initate the cube or if a lap
Could you please tell me where do i check the desktop cube rotate cube and viewport switcher plugins are enabled or not?
or if a laptop ctrl+alt+left or right arrows.  do you have ccsm installed?.  sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
I m in compizconfig setings:D.  Yes, it's installed:)
ok general options...Desktop size tab
I have done that step:).  after that I'm lost
ok now Desktop category.  enable Desktop cube Rotate cube and Viewport swticher plugins
done:).  and now?:)
ok now click on the Rotate cube plugin to get into its settings and push up the "zoom" slider to about half way.  is this a desktop or laptop?
a laptop:).  15,6"
ok ctrl+alt+ left click and hold or ctrl+alt+left or right arrows
Sorry maybe it's a stupid ideea, I'm a beginner ubuntu user, but tought it's interesting and always wanted to try it.
no problem
wow
I take it ..it's working?
wow, thank you from the bottom of my heart, this is so awesome!!!.  Thank you so much!
there you go and have fun :)
And another thing regarding paint with fire:P
if you need more help with compiz you can contact me in #compiz most of the time or one of the other support people
i was only able to move the cursore but the paint fire would not last...
mmm
i see the fire paint moving with my cursore but it doesn't last...
hold on
well, the only interface that was there was lo, so we added eth0 with "iface eth0 inet dhcp". doesn't apt do that by default?
curiously, does `set` list any $IF_WIRELESS_* settings?
I did :) No reply xD
:P.  If you google for Orion. It's decent, a lot more complexed, and very decent, you can get it running under Wine with some work
Is there no other way?
you may wanna start an administrative session i think... type sudo -l in the terminal and enter password.. it will last about 15 minutes
What do you mean? and how do I use?.
sudo apt-get install testdisk
then?.
sudo testdisk.  select your hdd
Ummmmmmm. no harddisk found
what does sudo parted -l say?
command not found. this is a VM btw.
sudo parted -l.  not found?
yes
type echo $PATH.  are you using ubuntu?
yes
ok, type echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games.
ok.  try sudo fdisk -l
No output
sudo lsblk -f
no output
try to restart the vm.  something isn't right i guess.  type which lsblk
/bin/lsblk
ok, does the vm use any special hdd or something?
I don't think so. How can I check?. .  [URL] Here's what "df -aTh" outputs.  can't I copy the ssl certs from another computer?
type mount | grep /dev/simfs
i can get it mounted.. but after like 10secs my /dev/sda2 is "gone"
anything in dmesg or other logs mentioning anything about it?
sysrg : usb 4-2: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 21. is the last thing before it's "gone"
never seen such an issue with my H140, sorry
in case of mass removing packages, we cant remember the package names...
see [URL]
nice google skill, that's what im looking for :)
its easier if you've seen the page before :-)
to build as small install as possible
why? if you really want that, use the server installer.  for a desktop computer, there is no need.
so if I keep switching users. it keeps layering and layering?. Lol
in a way yes, you spawn new terminals inside terminals ..
ty
it is actually not very useful to do that way ;)
how would you prefer it?
I have a terminal as user and another one as root
fair enough. you know how to reach me. thx!
or, I use "screen" (a terminal multiplexer) where I can have multiple shells in one terminal
thanks for the help!
You're welcome :)
yes, as ubuntu user
try make a new user and start teamviewer from there to test
hmm, already tried apt-get install firefox-2, it doesn't work, though I just had the idea to switch repoes maybe that would work
what error did it give you?
already using firefox3 (forgot about that when I launched firefox) but I have a backup so it's all good :)
firefox-2 - lightweight web browser based on Mozilla. thats the name and description
and i wont run into any problems with it? most likely?
But you need to make sure you copy it to the USB correct. And you need to make sure your computer supports booting from USB (most modern BIOS do).
how do i copy it correct
Are you currently on Windows?
yes windows 8
Follow the instructions here: [URL]
thankyou
You will need a USB with at least 2GB
jengerer: the changes are still there, it said the errors were like checking filesystem and stuff
Not sure, but if the changes are there, it should be OK.
ok ill try it now. jengerer: its asking me for Guided - Use entire disk with a sub option that says SCSI3 (0,0,0) (sda) - 300.1 GB ATA WDC WD3000JD-00k or i can choose Guided - use the largest continuous free space or another option is manual, what should i choose jengerer
Use the largest continuous free space.
i added it in the .profile file not in bash
the quotes are unnecessary too
ahh okay so its a syntactical error? let me try again brb.  okay still no luck :/. is there a GUI i can use?
what is your PATH right now?. echo $PATH on the terminal will tell you
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
what about echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
okay, at the last line of your ~/.bashrc file, add. export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH. and then run bash, and do echo $PATH again
okie dokie 2 min
conversely we could all just give up, and you could go copy all of the files in that scala-whatever/bin directory into /usr/local/bin. you'd have to use gksudo nautilus to bring up a "superuser" file manager so you have the permissions though
hmmm. weird. somethings changed but im trying to figure out what, it hasnt added scala-[URL]nal/bin but its added something
it probably added /home/user/bin, for user being whatever your username is
okay its added home/myname/bin. yeh
yes. so
add the contents of scala/bin to bin?
yes. then run eclipse from inside the terminal
i can't find the -zoom option... this is in the gui
it's buried in a config file... I forget which - I use xine now
ok... will look.  i found a empty config file....  can i put something there?
hang on a sec.  I think i's /etc/mplayer/[URL]nf
ok will check
it is - you set zoom=yes
thnx alot :)
np
hmm. ok. what can i do?
Which file-system that is depends on whether Ubuntu/Linux is installed with a separate /boot/ partition-file-system - if not, then GRUB's files will be in the operating system root file-system
i mumbled about the 15.04 live DVD i made him.  i doubt that he did the custom installation
first thing to do, when you get the "rescue>" prompt is to to find out where grub thinks its files are. "set" will report GRUB variables. The important two are "prefix" and "root"
ok  thanks let me go see
since the last successful boot have any extra storage devices been added (hard drives, flash storage - possibly attached with USB)
not usb but he's removed and replaced the motherboard and power supply, dunno which drives are different
Ahhhh! it is possible with a replacement motherboard that 1 of 2 things could change. The first is the mode the disk controller uses to access the disk drives. If the drive is relatively recent then the controller should be using AHCI mode, which needs setting in the motherboard Setup.
prefix=)nsd s6/boot/grub root=hd0,msdos1
the second issue can sometimes be that the mobo has multiple SATA controllers, and sometimes only 1 of them can have boot drives attached to its ports
ahh
There was a typo there with "prefix=..." I think?.  That 2nd issue can't be causing this since the mobo has managed to read the bootstrap and GRUB's [URL]g code from the drive
yes - i'm copying from notes - computer is across the room
give me a moment to start a GRUB virtual machine I have here, so I can replicate the "rescue>" situation
prefix=)msdos6/boot/grub.  thank you VERY much :)
That prefix - based on what root= says - should be "prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub"
i'll go look again.  it is actually what i'm typing - i agree that an umatched ) is weird. prefix=)msdos6/boot/grub
That is the fault then!
oh. how do we fix?
was the mobo replaced due to a fault? I wonder if another issue was corrupted disk drive contents
the board has an onboard nic - it wasn't seeing the lan
OK... well let's see what we can do about getting you from rescue into the real system
super! thank you :)
First you need to confirm that grub's [URL]g (which is what gives you the very limited rescue command-line) can see the drive. Type "ls" (LiSt) to see the drives and partitions that have been found. To fix this, you must be able to see (hd0,msdos1)
okies checking :).  (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1)
looking good then. OK 3 commands *should* get you booted. "set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub" then "insmod normal" then "normal" assuming no error messages from those commands you will now be at the standard GRUB boot menu
going to try :).  i put in insmod normal and got back: Error: Unknown file system
OK... this seems to indicate the disk is corrupt
ouch
You'll need a Live ISO image on DVD or preferably a USB flash device, boot that, and use to explore the extent of the corruption and either repair it, or recover vital data and reinstall
i see. what's the preference for USB?
In case it's not disk corruption, but the new motherboard+RAM modules causing memory corruption right now, when you start the Live ISO image at its boot menu use the 'memtest' option and thoroughly test the system RAM
ah ok good idea
I'd suggest the Ubuntu Desktop Live for 14.04 Trusty.  Right now we don't know if the corruption exists on the disk, or only once it has been read into system memory
no but i meant why USB over DVD?. good point
Time it takes, waste of a DVD
ok good he's got lots of dvds. has a thing about usb.
OK, well good luck with it :)
well i have a floppy disk in it, and when i go to storage it doesn't show anything on the floppy and i don't hear the drive
go to computer.  or give me a sec to boot up a computer with a floppy drive
yep
!ppc
better irc channel for it?
That is community supported since edgy.. NOt sure what channel they use.have.  /join #Ubuntu-ppc
oh hey :).  you also talked to me in the other channel
xD, I have like 6 different IRC window opened across couple servers so I tend to get a bit all over the place :P
even without network ?
what do u mean even without network?.  just do that command in failsafe mode, ur x server will work afterwards, did work for me. i had the same problem as u
02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cedar [Radeon HD 5000/6000/7350/8350 Series]. it's an HD 5450, 1gb I think

Gallium 0.4 on AMD CEDAR (DRM 2.46.0 / 4.8.0-58-generic, LLVM 3.8.0)
i'm on 17.04. driver in use >> lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A3 | grep 'in use' >> radeon. All i know it is a well supported card, if it fails it is dirty, or broken.. i didn't need nomodeset at all... all linux versions switch to open radeon en open amdgpu/amdgpu-pro
just curious - why do you need ppds when they have a whole linux driver suite?
because i don't like to have 3rd party debs in the system just for printing
It does so much more than just printing though. plus, you don't need the package if all you want to do is print. but I agree with your sentiment
right, i also want to use the duplex-thingy, which wouldn't work with plain PCL-drvers
Mine lets you scan documents from the printer and send faxes, etc.
i'm talking about printers, not multifunctional-super-devices :)
just installed Ubuntu, latest version - install goes fine but on boot Grub loading - Error 21
what raid config did you use
2nd time ive installed
or raid level.  is it hardware raid, software raid, fakeraid ?.  raid 0, 1,5
let me check and make sure, think its 2 disk aray with duplicate data
what type of raid, hardware/software/fakeraid
where do i find the alternate CD ?
[URL]
not sure what "time fix" you are thinking of, but I already rebooted like 5 times to no avail ;)
"Superblock last mount time is in the future. Fix? yes" <--- from your paste.  is your date/time correct?
no, the time wasn't correct - it's correct in the installed Kubuntu but in the LiveCD it showed up as 4 hours earlier. Adjusted it now, but do you think this was the problem?.  anyway, I'll try again now
are you able to enter failsafe/recovery mode in ubuntu and run a fsck on that partition/disk?.  yeah, if the time difference is to big you will get complaints.
yup, I can go into recovery mode and run fsck, but won't it be the same if I do it from the LiveCD?
I'm afraid that the live-cd might have the wrong time/timezone, so if you do it from there you will get the same error... (a guess but I think it's a valid guess)
random freezes. and ACPI/irq problems. not a linux problem, of course, HP acpi implementation seem bogus
Is it fairly new hardware?
1 year, more or less
It's quite possible that the newer kernel will like it more.
havent noticed any pattern. what is it for you?
there is a setting for which classes of windows slider and which classes stay fixed when you switch workspaces
does the bg slide with the ws?. ok ill tryto find it
check the settings for the "Desktop Wall" in ccsm
im currently doing so
there is a setting for "Non Sliding Windows".  those are the window types that stay fixed while you change workspace.. if you remove the "desktop" part there it will slide together with the icons
Nah, 7.04 and 7.10 too..  noacpi and so forth has been tried..  No joy, though.
i'm not familiar with the "so forth" switch. :) could you please elaborate?
Ah, nice, I asked because I have alot of first time linux users wanting to start with Arch for some reason lol
I totally understand them. It's simple in its very own arch way :).  my ex-gf's first linux was arch too :P anyway, that's off the topic here I believe
aha...
/dev is populated by udev, and udev is running only on the live-cd's /dev directory now
nope. i am running the stock firmware. 2.2
what version?.  then no, not without jailbreaking afaik
darn. even running windows in a VM wont work?
the 1.x hash used by apple was broken, but the 2.x hash, people are still working on (and apple doesn't help).  you might be able to do it with a vm with wondows like you said, but I've never tried
and yes I know..legalities legalaities
There's "java-package" for easily converting Sun's .bin downloads, though.
well then how on earth do other distors 'include them ' ?. not good enough. I want to see it work 'out of the box'
They don't support non-i386
why is that important to me ?.  and its a mistake. HUGE mistake
Then you're probably looking at getting another distro.
xubuntu is not even responding
you have been told that, now please follow it
ive tried 3 different ones, so... google or opendns
if you do not run your own, you are dependent on when they refresh
how about if i change the DNS provider on my router. isnt there some sort of local cache i can reset?
if your router acts as a DNS cache, possibly. It's a very wide question.
Yes, thanks
[URL]
ah there is it, thanks :)
you are welcome
it just dont work ;)
ok, it does for me
oh it does above some specific windows :P
:-)
i don't know i was out of the city, and my little syster was playing on the pc
that could be bad lol.
can you help me please??
ill try. do u have any partitions like windows
sup
shadow i may be able to. that was my first ever prob :D
what was ?
what gfx card you got ?
2.3-19ubuntu1
just checking if it's actually installed
appears to be
"ii" in front?
i updated a bunch of stuff and now i get a kernel panic at boot. cannot boot
k. what is the error? cannot mount /. ?. if you press escape and pick a different kernel out of the list, does it work?
Thanks, I will take a look at this now..  Mind telling me what exactly that does? I see that it the word manual is piped into the file ssh.override, but how does that change anything?
upstart override files allow you to modify the start on and stop on conditions of a service without modifying its config
not in sudoers file. incident will be reported.  when i type adduser user* admin it says no group admin
are you on a gneuine ubuntu?. *genuine
ok will try - thanks.  Thanks very much it worked and is now finishing the install
i've seen many people get stuck at that point. you're welcome and hope you enjoy Ubuntu
I DID just re-boot
Ah, ok.
I have no idea why it didnt work. th1 do you have an idea why it didn't work?
Can you post in the pastebin the contents of your replace-* file
how do I find the contents of my replace file?
I'm not really sure. That is something i think you did with th1 in private msgs.
th1 how do I get to the contents of my replace file?.  do you have another suggestion for me to replace these icons? They are VERY big.
I think th1 went on a brief vacation.  I'm pulling up th1's script again to see what I can make of it.
i want someones personal experience...
and I'm sure you'll find users of it there
Thanks.  Trying to figure out if i am able too stripe my boot partition
stripe? what do you mean?
using lvm. Like raid 0
oh, I don't know anything about using RAID, I know how it works, but I've never used it with linux
I know you cant raid 0 a boot partition with mdadm.  It's cool
Like, I've read detailed technical documentation on RAID, but i've never set it up on linux
On the lvm channel, figuring it out
cool . good luck with that. oh, what's the channel. I still have a question too, related to the one no one here could answer
Thanks man but i think i will have to mirror boot which is no biggie.  What was the question ?
if there is a way to make partitions adjust their sizes automatically, specifically my swap. I need more swap, but I ended up using commands to force it larger
how so?
there's a gui to get everything setup just like with vmware. kvm you have to use qemu on the command line and i find it a bit confusing
i believe there is a UI for KVM too. virt-manager, or something like that
its not that easy to use, and i think its for configuring existing vm's...but its been a year since i last used it
i have, multiple times. i dont see anyone getting help. lol
seems no-one knows the answer then
10.10 Maverick
from a PPA?
yeah
doubtful
i was just asking if I should upgrade or not.  I forget where I installed kubuntu from
you purged it? in lieu of the ppa?
I just ran and update after installing i believe that command ran. Let me try again.. sudo update-grub can't see the win7 install. both of them are eufi.. I don't know why grub can't see the windows install
looks like they have a solution here that works... [URL]
looks to me like regular cron log
the "cron login as root" should get logged in auth.log, wouldn't it?
nope ?
Dec 17 12:17:01 alkis CRON[29959]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0). This line needs to be in auth.log, as cron "logged in" to run things. But the output of cron of course isn't there
this line repeats every min or for every run of cron. mostly its in-consequential. its just filling up log
It's not a log of cron, but a log of pam
I needed to check ssh auth log
You're looking at the wrong place to disable it
do tell. I want to put use fedora along with ubuntu but do not have any usb or cds
what's installed right now?
ubuntu 12.04 LTS I also have an iso for fedora (not completely sure its the right one)
you got a swap partition?
yes
how big?
[URL]?
i'd suggest searching the wiki for "art project" or some such
does nothing
upower --dump
there we go. thanks
sure
yeah
is something using all your CPU?
yes, but it worked just fine yesterday and about everyday
what can you ping, the router?
right. I figured they were available somewhere, though...
read that page
*sigh* I would encode in Ogg/Vorbis, but this is for a non-tech crowd, and it's my responsibility to make it blindinly easy for them. Oh well..  yeah, I read it. Thanks for the link. Software Patents suck.
oh yes :/
sounds right.
thanks :)
what do you mean by redirecting?
go to your compiz settings, i think its under general settings, check the unredirect fullscreen windows box
thanks. But, it's already checked.
which app is it? compiz has problems with fs apps sometimes.  like with xbmc you have to use metacity
Firefox, T-bird, Open Office apps etc.
:S.  afraid i cannot help you with that.  nvidia?
yes, 8400GS running nvidia 180.
ok i have the 8400M.  i run beryl just fine.  try this [URL]piz-[URL]
it shouldn't but you should be able to delete that G
No. I can't get rid of the G.
weird
Yeah. It let me delete everything else
some gnome services I think.
Is there a link on how to disable usb automounting in the new gnome services?. ive tried everything. i even tried making my own udev rule that autoamtically unmounts it. i just need it for storage devices. hm
I was thinking ntfs-config tool tweaked some of those settings
ok ill look at it
heh. I haven't been able to find a deb for ubuntu
get it from sourceforge
I'll try that. BRB.  there is no PATH setting in .bashrc currently. I'm assuming it is set somewhere else first?
.profile there is a preset for ~/bin if ~/bin exists.
I see! So if I rename my "scripts" folder to "bin" then it will be in the PATH, correct?
yes, you will need to source ~/.profile or start a new terminal session.
Will it also be in the PATH for the graphical environemnt?
or, you can change that line in .profile to 'scripts' instead of 'bin'.  you mean a clickable icon?
I want to associate the script I've created with a keystroke. If it is in the PATH, then I don't have to give a fully qualified name, right?
just give it the full path. no real reason not to if you're setting a shortcut.
gotcha. I edited .profile, then opened a new term but ~/bin is not in the PATH. Do I need to restart?
no need to restart. what did you add/remove in .profile?
Nothing. I just renamed my scripts folder to bin.
echo $PATH does not include ~/bin in the newly opened terminal session?
basitdrazor: Negative..  :~$ echo $PATH. /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
[URL] your .profile is similiar to this?
Virtually identical except for the last 3 lines.
source ~/.profile ..that should add your ~/bin .. then try echo $PATH.  oh wait.. the lines about path are commented?? they have # before them?
No comments before those lines. That added bin to the beginning of the PATH. Now how do I make it do it every time I open a term?
it should do it automatically.
OK I'll try exiting and starting a new term..  No, it doesn't add it in a new term!
comment those lines in ~/.profile and add those exact lines to .bashrc .. then try a new terminal..  the newly added lines uncommented, of course.
That worked!
oddly now that i look at my settings i have it that way.. commented in .profile and added to .bashrc
Let me run this by you: The issue I was trying to solve is with my TrippLite USB KVM. The docs state that Scroll_Lock Scroll_Lock will switch under either Windows or Linux. It doesn't work under Ubuntu..  I determined that the issue is Gnome isn't sending back the command to toggle the Scroll_Lock LED. The script ruens on and off the LED and this works for switching.
no idea how to solve that. i've seen the same issue 4 years ago
that does not allow me to log in remotely
well, it allows you to use the gnome desktop remotely
ntfs-3g
!ntfs >  (read the private message from ubotu)
its on a live cd, not a real install, the main pri here is that i need to backup all documents from a crashing windows...
you can still use ntfs-config on the live cd. What exactly do you want to do?.  just do 'gksudo nautilus' then
yes.  yes
if you use swat or webmin you an just switch it on, try swat it's really nice and powerfull to configure samba
ok I can just switch it on do you mean synaptic install webmin?
yes - swat is even nicer it has more documentation links for the options.  and more options
I did that but it just put one on top of that panel too!
You can always drag and drop
Thank you very much!.  Thank you for your help
happy to help :)
no just ubuntu.
is it all on the same partition, or do you have more than 1?
there is no reason to expect file fragmentation or weirness?
Fragmentation would be unusual what is the problem?
it`s just I get told there are major fragmentation problems with linux, and ext3, and horrid hardware graphics support. am I in?. can someone read me?
yes
something happened, major flooding. there is an ignore fuction in xchat, but I cant make it work.  and btrfs is sort not yet usable
I use /ignore "user" all.  So I hear but it is not claimed to be, not many use it those that do should be using it.
I upgraded Ubuntu from 12.10 to the latest version, and flash stopped working on Chrome. It works on firefox.
[URL]  you can look there to see, factually, what flash you are using in which browser.. could be google is not updating the PPA for 12.10, since its EOL
it says i have version 11,2,202,378 installed
you can read there that 11 is the older version, thats is the only version adobe provides desktp linux. you can get the latest from chrome, but, you are using a dead operating system.. that is not getting updates. you are not promised updated versions of anything in 12.10 any longer automatically
yes I am

that's part of the standard kernel, aiptek.ko.  I think you just need userspace software for it now.
what i hav to do now?
is the tablet connected at present?
yes
do a 'lsmod | grep aiptek'.
i did
any output?
yes, do u need to know it?
no, if there was output, it's loaded (unless there was an error)
9.10.  i thought its happening due to firefox flash-plugin combo, but it happened a few time when was not using firefox or flash-plugin
Hm, I used to have the similar problem in 9.04, but a 9.10 fresh install solved that. Don't really know what caused it as well, sorry.
did you tried to trace logs ?.  give me a guess, what can be the issue ?
I tried to find the problems in the system logs various times, but couldn't find any error message at all. If I were to guess, it'd be firefox.
sure, but kinda tiring in the long run..:).  no more permanent solution?
you could set your choice as standard, i dunno if that still works after updating kernel.
I wanna be prompted to the grub menu automatically=(
that option should be in the manual. !grub2
ty
and i mean vim, no vi
ok. note taken
according to "man apt-get" that would work.
ok sure
can you right click and bring up a menu
yeah, so the right click menu is the only menu i have?. yes i *can* right click and bring up a menu ^^

maybe vlc?.  yeah I have packaged vlc here on edgy and it plays so that's worth a try
yes.  the module is there.
cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep GLX.  cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep GLX
I don't, it's a laptop monitor
reboot?
i tried to set in interfaces file. but no work :(
In the network thing in your System -> Admin
>> i want from CLI
I'm not sure how to help you then.
: so it is about tutanota right ?
i dont quite understand the issue.  did you trigger the mail in launchpad somehow?.  maybe signing the code of conduct or something?
I'm prepared to regress if I know that it will fix my issues.  Are you using it and can you confirm that it fixes things?
personally ive found the lts has the most reliable support.. its rock solid..you cant shut the server down with a shotgun.
D'oh!. I knew it was something stupid like that. Now I feel like a tool. :P
Nah, its not obvious
there is linux-swap partition right next to it, but I'm not sure how to move it in order to make adjacent unallocated space for the ext4 partition
also, do not try to modify partitions on the storage the current Os is running from. crate complete backups before making any such modifications
yes, it _is_ a backup image of my os I'm trying this on.  I made an image of my system on a larger disk, but now I still have to figure out how to make the /dev/sda partition on that bigger, in order to actually use the space
show a screen shot or textual output from a utility such as parted, sgdisk. /dev/sda is a drive, not a partition
[URL] sorry, I mean /dev/sdb1.  which is an image of my original /dev/sda1
so you only want to increase the size of sdb1, right?
yes.  but I'm not sure moving the swap partition /dev/sdb2 and /dev/sdb5 is supposed to be done, I tried with the resize/move option, but it looks wierd
my explanation may bewrong since i haven't done this in a while: first, see if you can move sdb2 to the end of the available (unallocated) storage area on sdb, so that the grey area will be between sdb1 and sdb2. then you need to resize sdb1.
can I message you in a dialog box ?
no. i probly dont have an answer for your question. !ask
how
-> look in the crontab. -> or use top to see what process is going on
yes, it's bnew.. i think it is.
second, is the right kernel module being loaded
trying to install ieee80211
for what device?
yea, it does. i see what i want, i did the mount command, didnt get an error
ok cool ..  and to automaticale mount it on all system start .. write it to /etc/fstab
so its in /media/windows now, right?
shoudl be,,
raid1 : [URL] - for some reason disk sde was left out, even though the disk shows in /dev/.  ah, found it - mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/sde1
glad to help :-)
well if you mount a hd it is in media but where are the other usb devices ?
you don't mount devices
yes i know cant find the right word but there is a dir where the bus and device is
do you want /dev/usb?.  /dev/bus/usb?
So remove the &&?
The && and the export
I'll give it a spin
You sure the file is allowed to be executable by the crontab?
yes, it is executable by owner,group,other
Oh okay
: that's what i figured ... insmod reports that it can't find the file
the module you want is 3x59x I believe actually.  at least that's what this computer is using.  excuse me, 3c59x
is there a way to do it from dos ?
Kris_K, you can use lilo from dos. I can't tell you the details though.
Aha, but is it fixed or shall I install it through the CD?
try the cd first
Alright, when I install with CD can I import my whole /user folder to the new version? :)
DId you create a sep /home partition
Dont know really
sep /home will make everything easier in the future.
I am sorry, I really didn't understand what you just said, can you explain it to me step by step
do you have a floppy drive?
usb 2.0
no ideas
K3B didin't worked here.. and I aldo don't have KDE.
arf... sorry
sorry, no man. You just wanted to help.
:-)
well, it doesn't look like ubuntu lgin. it's black screen, with the bar down. prompt window is gray
did you install any updates or such prior to the reboot?
I did install apache
nothing else?
but not sure if it was in that exact session. I don't think so
what keyboard-layout do you have normally?
not all them. only youtube stuff can i see
and I thing the "restricted extras" comes with the flash plugin
ok, well anyway ty
but the quick answer should be "yes, you should"
yeah, works with vesa
or, rather, "vesa"
I would if I knew which partition my swap is.  fdisk -l /dev/sda claims not to be able to open the device
sudo
is there some cool soul that can help me?.
dont know if im a cool soul, but kopete will do the job :
I did and the bars are all at the maximum speed, but it's still too slow
does your mouse have a button on it that changes the sensitivity?
no.  it's the thinkpad built in wheel mouse.  or trackpad, or however it's called *g.  it's just significantly slower than in 9.4
the joystick thing or the touch pad?
yes
why are you getting quantal packages ?
no idea ... :P.  is it something that could be coming through backports?
have you got backports enabled....?
I think it's enabled by default ...
really shouldn't be
I was not asked to select the repos I wanted to have enabled during install ...
I'd be very surprised if backports is enabled by default on LTS releases.
yes, just checked the [URL]st file and "deb [URL] precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse" is there. and enabled. so it's being enabled by default now it seems ... odd
that's not good
I will disable them right away
keep in mind, that's just my opinion
I got compaq and am happy with it, but I'm going to buy a new one. what about mac books?
should work just fine, but I haven't tried it.
what do you mean "esoteric"?
sony tends to put really weird hardware that nobody else uses in their machines....  that stuff tends not to work.
hmm... I booted a sony vaio with knoppix and the wireless and ethernet got recognized out of the box
yeah...those things tend to be fine, but in my experience, some of the "multimedia" stuff won't work well.
I have no blank cd's and I only have inet. and I won't wanna lose a lot of what I have on this hard drive
you should backup, and on this install add a partition for /home also, !clone below will help you with resetting packages. !clone |
oh i found it. right in front of my face
k
@ fstrim -v shows not activated at kernel mostly debian-8.2 servers with SSD
not on ubuntu
i have to fix [URL]nf and upgrade-initramfs. no
better ask in #debian how they handle fstrim
but why is ubuntu active and debian prevent users from usage??. found no release notes on net
maybe they go with discard mountoption. but again: ask them why, not ask others to guess
ok thanks. i will keep closer look. some howtos offers infos about damaged SSDs with the usage of fstrim!!. see debian-SSD area
---> #debian
but iam confused why ubuntu basics far away from deb. thanks
its based on debian. not exactly debian. that was the reason to make ubuntu at the start. to do some things differently.
my computer screen is splitted up into 8 parts
what do you mean with split?
means my display looks like tiles. means my display looks like tiled.  ok i telling u in detail.  i working on pc and suddenly it stopped working n shutdown
Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/[URL]nf
yeah, i did it, but is failing to start
: whats the output?
ok i see. thnx. Nvidia FX550 should be supported though ?. Nvidia Quadro
look at the xgl docs and see if it's on the list. if not, it won't work. !xgl >
got a link ?
check out the wiki link ubotu gave you. it's a great starting point
<> done
type grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
Installation finished. No error reported.
type update-grub
done, it seems he finally found my os
ok, did it say found vmlinuz?
yes
ok, type exit
reboot now?
yeah
manual ipv4 settings?
sounds good
oh :) it says 8 :).  is'nt 64 default?
do you have the server kernel installed?.  or just roll your own kernel.
like how it should operate.. soundsettings.. and outs and ins.. all that stuff..
there is the volume control up in the right hand corner, you can select most if not all through there..  in terminal you can also type "alsamixer" and adjust through there. be care ful what you are adjusting.
yeah I saw that one. it left me quite unsatisfied thou.. I like it to be more! :)
more graphical? :P
alsamixer.. ok. is that a graphical interface,,?
it is ncurses/dialog based. its not pretty but it will get the job done :P
ok
rhythmbox, why must you be mean :( crashes after so long of streaming internet radio.  did you check out alsamixer?
yes...  only volume settings there.. I will search in apt-file to see if I can find any packages
You can set other stuff than volume..  atleast with my SB, there are about 30 settings
what kind of settings do u have?.  can u set freqvens and stuff..
not freqvens, i have a lot of the linein/lineout, video, IEC958, C,L,0,T and other stuff
yes. sorry
i am behind a router
well, thats your first line of defense... make sure your router is set up properly.
oh ok. well thanks everyone for your input :). i greatly appreciate it :)
i need it to be automated, not sure that's the best way because you don't know how long dhcp will take
an ugly way to do that - cron.  i don't know of any other ways. recently there have been changes in X-related packages and it made my DRI not work. do you know how to get a list of packages that were updated in last 7 days? I want to roll back the X-related packages to older version but I need the names.
you know the roll-up thing
MPX: if ypu are refering to the hidden configurations files on your home, you have to manually delet them
ok  I'll check there thanks
np
I found an emacs folder but it's empty : /usr/local/share/emacs/22.2/site-lisp
then I guess you should put there something :-P.  I can't help you so much; I'm a Vim user. Sorry.
nope
Does it output anything?
ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co. Ltd. TRL-8913/8913C/8193C+ (rev 10)
Ok.  That just means you have a diffrent chipset then I do.  Goto System --> Administration --> Networking
and ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, INC. AR 5212 802.11abg
goto System --> Administration --> Networking.  You should see Ethernet Connection
I am a DOOFFF. I see that
Click On It
click enable right
Yep. Then Try to goto a webpage. like google.  Did it work?
evil_whisper, yeah thanks.
No Problem, Does your wifi work as well?
evil_whisper, they both just needed to be enabled and set to DHCP.
Awsome glad it works. :-). *Awesome
evil_whisper, thanks for the help.
Your welcome glad I could help :-)
I don't know where I'm going wrong, on the key properties the 'Revoke Signature' button under the Trust tab is greyed out
I'm running 2.24.1 and I do have some revoke buttons here and there
im using the iwlagn driver but all i get i wireless G performance
-> come again?
all i get is 54 Mb/s to my wireless n router it should support about 130 Mb/s
-> do you really honestly expect that rate on the internet?
no but in my local network at least
-> and what have you accomplish in such?
faster transfers between my workstation and file server.  i have 100 Mb/s from my isp so it would be nice to get at least that.
-> good luck with that.
what's the default routes table in ubuntu?
use command 'route' to list current set routes
can they be hot-swapped without downing an interface?.  thank you.
yeah, through network-manager
you mean the GUI manager?
right. or by the route command on the terminal itself.
I'd rather use the route command. I'm allergic to GUI tools..  I don't want to have to configure an ssh-forwarded app just to change routes.
'man route'.  for starters ;-)
thanks i'll try that.  i now see gears, does this means im using the correct driver?
looks like it :)
i am trying to boot a system with /dev/mapper/nvidia_bleh
uh huh. ok
I know, but I have never done manual partitioning. What are the recommended settings?
If you're new to this, use one partition with >5GB..  And remember of a swap partition..  How much RAM do you have?
And make the main partition ext3?.  2GB
Yes, use ext3. And 2 GB for swap as well..  (if you have that space left)
Ok thanks. Yeah, the second partition is 74GB in size
Caution with the bootloader installation step!
Thanks again.  Yeah, I will install the bootloader on the same partition
Let the bootloader install into the root partition of your new installed ubuntu.
Ok Thanks.  If I need more help, I will come back in here
Then alter your old bootloader ("chainloader +1").  Good luck.
what do you mean?
currently non-english keyboards are totally borked
ok..  nice to know it's not my fault.
yes
what drivers do you use for it?
the intel ones? let me see what i actually have installed.  xserver-xorg-video-intel
Will having xserver-xorg-video-vesa installed interfere with other installed drivers?
dont know about 'others' it does not effect intel driver
I have that installed too. From the default repos right?
yeah, we sort of got the straight forward no frills graphics, it can do opengl though, so i am not complaining
will that tutorial for installing LAMP for 5.10 work with this version as well (6.06)
i would say so (but can't be totally certain) - the package names are unlikely to have changed
thank you. is it a bad idea for me to edit fstab to fix that mistake?
I'd just change the mount point for /dev/sdb1 to an empty folder OR change the ref to /dev/sdb1 to /dev/sda1..  also, back up fstab before editing it.
check ATI pages, they have good explanations where to go and what is supported where
lol ok
?. I need a site making..  Are they on irc?
nah.  I think you'll need to do a google search
Done that. After loads of dependency troubles, it didn't help worth amonkey.
if you needed to install depencies, you might be installing the wrong package
I very much doubt that.. Is there a way to just start over without a disc? :P
not very good at fixing this type of issue, sorry
trying to run vedics...found a package install for lucid. but i get this error.... ImportError: No module named gi. File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/vedics/vedics.py", line 24, in <module>. import gi
well gi is gobject introspection. But where did you get vedics from?
tons of bugs files ans whatnot on that error. but i dont see...umm hol don. [URL]
well you should start by installing python gobject introspection I suppose. Are you sure this .deb is meant for your version of ubuntu?
well the gui..front endy thing liked it?. and ya i got pyton-gobject installed already
well can you "import gi" in python?
ya that didnt do it ither
what do you mean? It doesn't do anything. It gathers information.
import gi... i run that ..and it doesnt import anythang
what was the result?
just came back to the command prompt..no error..just nothing
run "python" first. Then "import gi"
Thanks, I'll try that....
yw
I'm getting errors trying to instlal the package, what would the correct syntax be to install the .deb?
I am uncertain I am not fluent enough to guide you correctly sum1 else will help you
Thanks man, I'll post the report on pastebin or somewhere and ask the question ;)
anytime
have you set an root password yet for the mysql-server
I think so .. yes!
then try echo "CREATE USER 'test'@ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';" | mysql -p -u root. sry i have to go now but i'm back in about 30 minutes.  perhaps someone else can help you or you have to wait for me sorry
I have lots of time :).  I just want to add a user to mysql, so I can use it to use PHP-nuke ....  and I havent really made a database yet I think :D. Does anyone know how I make a database in mysql, and add a user to this one?
well, it wont join a wireless network with wpa or wpa2 encryption, it does see all networks, but keeps saying the password is wrong.
use wicd?
i have started the wicd daemon..
you need to do a bit more
what? :)
run wicd-gtk
how?
make sure that is is executable and then just double click on it
double clicking gives an error saying it doesnt recognize the file type
what about trying to run it from command line?
how can I change it?
probably you have a video driver that have a gui
how can I fix this problem?
did you install a video driver recently?
yes nvidia gtx580 driver
is there a gui for the driver?
Word.
also if you want the kde login manager, kdm
Any noticeable benefits over GDM?
Not particularly as far as my opinion. Others may have different views
ehh, I can always get it later if I want it
Yup, exactly
[URL]
i disabled screensaver and it still went crazy
what is 'time'
the time command, or the 'TIME+' coloumn in $ top?. because they are different
so java should install on this firefox?
yeah it should
so kill it?
hehe.. problems are there to be solved
oh. ty rol, ill check it out
also not sure why atheros card is not automatically picked up. Driver is not blacklisted is it?
dunno. im somewhat of a linux noob. still learning my way around the system and commands etc
gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist -- look for ath
dpkg: parse error, in file '/var/lib/dpkg/updates/0000' near line 0:. field name `f16a9dfb6feb162e95da9628a57b004a' must be followed by colon. that.  my PC froze when trying to install a wireless driver (proprietary) so I guess that messed dpkg over. Can I reset it?
interesting; that's the first time I've seen the --reconfigure -a command not fix things. you could try an apt-get clean perhaps?
Firefox and 1.0
no, I'm not having that issue with the latest firefox on hoary
hmmm. Wonder what would happen if I uninstalled and then reinstalled.
tried reconfiguring it?. yes. it IS hoary -- things break. so, try a reinstall first
yea I know. :)
if you play around -- submit a bug report if the problem still happens
hummm.. I did try ls -alD which worked but also gave me the file names in the directories. That was too much.. I"ll give you're a go to.
-d only shows directories :)
damn, how can i be sure ?.  its since 2004
boot live cd. fsck it manually look at error messages.
ok thanks :)
6 yrs old.. id say its time to upgrade. :) they are not that much $$ these days.  if nothing else. a new one will be a lot faster, and BIGGER
I had just plugged in a memory stick and the power cord when it went.
are you sure that it is ubuntu that died, and not your main board?
everything froze, the numlock and capslock lights flashed on and off. No commands worked, not even REISUB (though I don't know if that ever works)
I mean, is the system booting at all? the bios. not that I can help though, my own 7.10 just packed up today, showed unusual load, I had to power-cycle, then, that was it.
oh it works again now, I'm doing everything I normally do
cool. me, I had to do a clean install... fsck was telling me to go get a new HDD :p
no, especially since just a minute ago my drive was read write :-) in dmesg there's an ext3 error and then ubuntu remounted it read only (whatever, that seems better than just dropping it, but now I need to get it back)
maybe boot a live cd and do an fsck on it
yeah probably
I did find this sudo mount -n -o remount, rw /
?. What you mean
you were asking abot "a file", so my first tip is, to look what kind of file it is, therefore the command file ...
thanks, will let you know if this works
:)
do you know which?
i would guess the xfce file manager. :P.  or ya can install any of a dozen others.
any reason why?
it's a bit like a sidebar, and i've always found it easy to have sitting there on your desktop, can take a little work to get it functioning though
oh i see thanks guys. it says it couldnt find the package
did you enable universe?
do i need to download. no. how do i do that
ubotu: tell  about universe
how do i enable universe
check your private messages from ubotu. !es
Point made. After installing an nVidia driver, display stopped outputting to my laptop's screen and came out on the VGA output..  It doesn't seem to give the option to use laptop's LCD screen under display settings either (in the GUI anyway).
any errors when rebooting?
No apparent signs. On startup in the latest kernel, there are a pair of messages that flash by too fast to read on the LCD. It then switches to outputting onto VGA
by vga you mean you have a monitor attached? try unpluggin it see if you catch any errors, brb ...
thks, i install all the plugins for dvd codecs, etc..  but when i want to see a movie, Totem sya that there is no plugin to manage the movie.  the error message is in spanish then i'm just trasleting to english....  can you help me?
jfr3ak: the way fixed that is go to add and remove and install VLC... and it will install what you need
the vlc plugins ??.  the vlc is a app to see movies right ??
jfr3ak: when you mark VLC it will automatically get what you need to play dvds , mp3's and what have you
thanks alot
np
need backup..wine command does not exist
have you enabled universe?
that was the only format the download came in
googling for 'ubuntu alchemy' found no .deb?
I haven't googled for it yet, but apparently GetDeb can install it
awesome
thanks
cheers
right right before release it was installable :)
maybe right now is still installable. you must wait
well ok will do
intel + jaunty = not compatible. linux + windows = virtualbox (?)
well  kdm keeps on freezing for no apparent reason, and when I try to log out of an account the computer hangs
oh that happened to me in edgy when I was using xfce, and I was using integrated graphics. Never found the problem
it is absolutely driving me insane
I never logged out, just one user. and I had auto login setup anyways
just a lightweight laptop. nothing special
then you probably don't need to do any additional configuration other than the fresh install
i don't need to download drivers or anything?
if your installer was connected to the internet it should have automatically identified the drivers that it knows exist and installed - if there's a hardware thing NOT working, then you can ask and we can try and find you drivers to install/compile manually
vlc, eh?
sorry, I'm new at this but I've had a zillion problems, I want to try to help with the little bit of knowledge I have haha
sudo apt-get install vlc?
I got it through the Applications>Add/Remove.  i don't know if that would have anything to do with it though (using VLC instead)
so cat file file file?
try a google search for concatonate linux for some examples. well a basic cat example might be cat xaa > file; cat xab >> file
[URL]
one would be inn the qemu system
clicked off
yep :).  so yeah..if you get stuck with no xserver..you know how to find us now :D
I can get there even from that DOS looking text screen Iwas getting before?
sure can yep
sudo su -
One sec
daily it says --- mb will be needed for these updates, like that. how to remove old kernel?
mb to dl not to install.  once installed to cleans all that out.  well 10.10 shouldent have anynold images
hi, ok like make an iso of data info just for testing cd roms.  i vaguely remember some method of doing that in linux.  i know i can burn it with mkisofs
ok, is this just binary white noise?
yeah
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.out bs=1MB count=100
yes. sudo wvdial
actually I have already sent him the files, then told him to "sudo dpkg -i gnome-ppp-<version number blah>" from /var/cache/apt/archives, he says wvdial is not installed
install it - sudo apt-get install wvdial
BTW me doing a "sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp --download-only" will also download the wvdial package, so that means that the [URL]b is already in the PPP.tar that I sent my friend
yeah that's what i thought. less trying to make all work =\
and flash9 for linux will be out shortly
ahh sweet just a bookmark, thankyou :)
np :)
well  i dont wanna get rid of my windows. and i dont have the windows key anymore. so. thats not an option
you can delete the 11.04 partition but you'll have to be sure that that you have the correct partition selected for deletion
yeah  thats what im doing right now.  it says no root file system is defined
ok you can delete the install 12.04 over 11.04 while retaining the windows partition for dual boot
how
are you as the custom disk partition setting?
yeah
you're suppose to put " / " as the root partition .. pleaae be sure windows is not selected
yeah . what do you mean ?
file system is suppose to be ext4
i use mount -t vfat /dev/hdaX /mnt/xxxxx. eyequeu, it's wrong..??
i've never used that fs myself, but let's troubleshoot. what error do you get?
root@komputasi24:/mnt # mount -t vfat /dev/hda4 /mnt/windows/. mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda4,. or too many mounted file systems. (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,. instead of some logical partition inside?). root@komputasi24:/mnt #. ups, iam sorry... :(
does the phrase at the end apply?
dose any one know MB-ruler like program
What's that do?
thanks  I think I just found out here: [URL]
you can sometimes get a clue by looking at the browser cache
my wife has been accessing my pc while i am asleep.........
or get software like that which is used to monitor kids access.  oic. well she likes the Penguin
- Dunno. I am using Totem
run gstreamer-properties.  if you are using ximagesink, that is expected since you are not using the hardware scaler
ok of course that is where all the config files are stored. just out of curiosety how do i search for a file
use <unconvertable> locate <unconvertable> or <unconvertable> find <unconvertable>
did that, how can i see howmany rules i have now?. there's alot of information
Look at the INPUT chain and count them.
Win XP.  I've been Google'ing around with not much luck
tsao with regards to?.  with regards to
the slow performance?
slow performance of what?
the entire OS. mostly GUI stuff. but it seems everything really
you can't expect it to run super fast... what is your host OS? and what processor do you have?
host is Windows XP, 3GB Memory, 2.4ghz processor
which processor, it makes a difference
neuro: lol .i..
5.10 == breezy
neuro: just kidin
lol
hmmm I was looking for a link and didnt see one ty.  hmm ok well the download as pdf only includes the index....any ideas??
Next thing to try I guess is a recursive wget. [URL]
no stdio.h
after installing build-essential? sure?
distro: yup. But it definately must have something to do with drivers though, right?
yeah, I believe so
thing is, how do I find the right one?
I've just tried a couple of things from a Google on: emu10k2 ubuntu
computer or bios? Because the computer is a haphazard of upgraded parts and such
ok what processor and how much ram. it goes to ~/Downloads
intel celeron 2.4 GHz, 512 MB of RAM.  the bios is Asus P4XP-X
have you ever booted a livecd before?
I want to use it on EeePC 700 2G Surf. but still I have to keep one partition for Windows XP. now I'm using SliTaz, but I really liked Plasma-netbook, but it's too slow from SD card.  [URL]
yes <unconvertable>
Same problem as me?
the ubuntu version is old
it was working for ages, then suddenly did this. even deleteing .kde/share/apps/amarok didn't fix it
yes, mine occasionaly hangs on the start, usually it works it self out after a reboot or the removal of the ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok directory. lol ribs. you thought of the same thing i did
:).  people who use amarok a lot often have to do that, I think :)
the ubuntu package is out of date and i don't like that :'(
Well yeah, it will be. All hoary version numbers are fixed unless security updates come out
i know that
the file is in .rar ....do i need to extract it first?
probably
Are you sure? Have you used yourself?
a while back, yeah
Do I need some more packages to have support for SSL?
I'm not sure. :( do you need SSL or TLS? TLS used to get autonegotiated for me when I used lftp
where there any tricks? i have it where the other user (using gmail web video client) can't see me, but can hear me and i can see AND hear them
just enable the plugin, it all works after that
what plugin?
the Video and webcam plugin
voice/video settings plugin?
yup
did you change the settings from default?
nope
hehe. Biochem is a little tough, but it's very interesting.
as long as you find it interesting and enjoy it :)
CXT AC-Link Modem
I'm not on ubuntu - got a package named ac97-modem?
did that, no luck. the module is loaded and i don't see any complaints in dmesg but alsa only sees my onboard card
how did you check?
i reinstalled it
do you see the little flash games there?
i see some pictures. i see them
can you play the games?. if you do, you have flash, and your youtube videos problem is most likely due to other issues
yes i can play. i any page with flash movies i have the same problem
if you press the right/button on a game, what version of flash does it report for you?
I was running a manual driver installation it seems. and that update is queued. but I don't dare to install it, as I fear it'll break more
It shouldn't really break anything, if you're already stuck in recovery :) Does the opensource driver work for your system? You can try it as a temp. solution to boot normally
it says that the NVIDIA X driver is not in use3
in restricted drivers manager, does it say the nvidia driver is enabled and in use?
yes
it says "in use" in the status field?
yes
try restarting X (ctrl-alt-backspace) and try to run nvidia-settings again
i have tried that
its very strange that nvidia-settings wont run if youre running their driver!
that didn't work for me
that would be the command: gnome-keyboard-properties.  run that via alt+F2 or from a terminal
I have that on my menu, but when i change it to some other layout it doesn't work
may need a logout and back in possibly
Are there further actions required such as grub updates?
Nope, that's all done automagically :)
just connect to different wifi networks
i'm not a network guru ;-) but i always start with 'iptraf'.  it's just a 'monitroing' tool though. monitoring*. hi
thank you sir, I will try that one.
cheers :-)
Um... I believe static.. I had wifi working last night, but... now I can only connect through the ethernet port.
was it the gateway address you were asking about
No.... Um, when I click the two monitors once, it automatically brings up Connection Properties..  Here, this explains more. [URL]
has it worked on wifi in the past?
Yeah, just last night.. Then its battery died last night, and... Well, it's screwy.
then im not sure i can really help you, i misunderstood your original qeustion and thought i might be able to. I don't know much about wifi.
well, I don't really need help with wifi, but I do need help with just getting to change the settings properly.
you could try "sudo ifconfig" on the terminal and see if that gives you any info.
If I click the two monitors once, it brings up the connection properties instead of the little dropdown that says "wired connection" "wireless" and all that....
i don't know anything about the gui config stuff. i can't get my ubuntu running from the disk, i am running debian right now. "sudo ifconfig" should list the properties of all the connections though, it might shed some light on the problem
I typed that, but... all that came up, I have no idea what it all means...
does it have asection for eth0 as well as wlan0?
Yeah.
are you still there?
Yes.
is there a section for wlan0 in the ifconfig output?
Yeah..  Yeah, there is.
is it configued with an ip address, inet_addr is i think what it says
SNES9X is better than zsnes..  No there isn't one...
try "ifup wlan0".  you'll have to sudo that
Um it said "Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0"
the network interface config file needs to have an entry for wlan0 then, im not sure where ubuntu keeps that file. on debian its /etc/network/interfaces
So, how do I find that, and fix it?
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
i maybe have idea, maybe should be to auto not to none. is thre possible to run fstab without restarting
yes, do sudo mount -a
beear: [URL]
ah sorry, I use transmission for my bt client
looks like a firewall of sorts
I use iptable + firestarter for my firewall
hmmm firestarter?
painless firewall
firestarter vs ufw ? thoughts?
u're choice, though I like firestater because I see the button and current in/outs on the bottom
im low on HDD space
the packages can take up to 500mb, as set in /etc/apt/[URL]nf.d
it says invalid opertion autoclean, & anyways stale apps is not my issue, apart fromt hat i feel there is more space been taken by somethin
not stal apps, but the stale packages you download, which are then unpacked and become the apps ;) . And sudo apt-get autoclean should work
well that worked, but doesnt make much of a difference
install/run baobab , it's a graphical indicator of disk usage
no, I mean what is the command to actually pull up that gui app
sudo synaptic
both preferably, just trying to figure out how long this ls-lR is going to take and how big it is going to be
use this. find /path/fromwhere7you/count | wc -l
ok thanks
because roaming means that you just connect to the best available network where you are atm, even if you move
ok. i'm turning it off
np
because I want to. I want veetle

yeah, sure, but i want it....;) *like a child* :S

final or rc1 from hoary?
its not in hoary. but i only did a apt-get update an 1hr ago
just don't want to do a distro upgrade in two days. ;)
if there are any show-stoppers that get through the final bit of beta, why not let others find them, instead of your work machine?
Well, it's basically my home laptop, that I carry around.
ah, that's a bit different than my usual conception of a production machine :-) i imagine it will be fine, then.
you mean that each package gets added to the version depending on when it's needed (some packages are added even well after the ubuntu version is released {my partner is asking this})
no. each package is "certified" (inexact term, but low on coffee) and added to the repo when all the necessary dependency/plugin/work is complete. so it's not unusual to see a lag on a specific package and its appearance in the ubuntu repos. !vnc
gOS is an easy-to-use, Ubuntu-based distribution designed for less technical computer users
but it's not supported by Ubuntu
_VM_ Ok thanks!
np
well i'm not sure what the problem is other than fail to ban is installed but not functioning....  well i'm not sure what the problem is other than fail to ban is installed but not functioning...
well the thing is I know nothing of fail to ban, I can do some fairly basic stuff with iptables so I am not use to you :-/
if I installed the 32, is there a way to upgrade to 64 without a full reinstall?
no
also can anyone tell me why my firefox 3 is crashing 1000x more than firefox 2 i have to kill it all the time with kill -9
i've never tried it myself, I just did a search for it
cuz i want to capture everything printable i see in the terminal but im not sure if this is possible
alt-p allows you to search through previous commands too, there are a bunch of useful commands you can google
bash logs saves the previous commands but not including the output
oh, you want a full log, not sure aobut that
i want to log everything including the output i see in the terminal window
I'm looking into this further
what will that do?
undo last change, you can do it repeatedly to undo several changes
wow. how come thats not printed at the top of every monitor on the planet? lol.
well, it is :P under the edit menu in most programs. but it is one of the failures of communication from the IT industry that it is not common knowledge.
if i go back now to the last active window where this happened (in my yahoo mail account) will this work? is a keylogging app still a good alternative for retrieving text?
try it, I think it works in all mainstream browsers.
are you familiar with use of keyloggers, also? i can imagine if i was a coder or some such programmer how frustrating it must be for the computer to 'eat' your last hours work.
I'd advice against a keylogger solution..  which ubuntu version are you on?
home folder
yeah - its like "my documents" on windows.
so..thats the home directory?
yah.
what for?
to search for which package provides which files
how do I find out what the IP address of the guest is in that situation?
not actually sure what system that does the resolving there.. but "ip addr" from inside the vm lists it.  avahi/bonjour is nice to have in these kinds of situations, so that all you need to know is the hostname. in case you don't want to figure out how to somehow get the IP from virtualbox :)
as i have 3 smp boxes at home here too
linux-image-2.6.9-1-686 on hoary. linux-image-2.6.9-1-686-sm6 on hoary. er smp
:)
apt-cache search 686-smp
cheers
.. yes
i set crontab to execute my script but no success
did you set up the time correctly? whats the line from there crontab?
python-epydoc.  I just want to produce HTML. ;-)
it lists tetex-extra as a recommendation not as dependency.
thank you. this is actually linux/ubuntu based though
it's either a networking question or an ubuntu question
its ubuntu... can i force a program to only use a specific network interface...
depends on the program i suppose
no i just want to draw a rectangle on my desktop, just to see what it represents on my desktop
just drag mouse doesnt work?
what do you mean? how can i mesure the 1280*720?
why do you need the exact region like that?
i need to make a video of my desktop with this resolution (with camtasia) and i need to know how much place i'll have with this resolution. so how could i measure such a triangle?. such a rectangle*
hmm, if I was you, i would record all the desktop and then cut them to the resolution I want...
might .. you have unreal tournament and doom 3 both huge games and avalible on linux
... it wont happen... until their is a universal thing that beats directx we may never see natively compatible games for linux. on the widescale. yea but those are two of how many games
well thats why we have consoles :D
but consoles dont live up..... ill just pray that cedega can keep up. yea i have one.... amd64 3200 dtr overclocked to 2500mhz and a 6800GT slighly overclocked. thats another thing.... linuxers dont necessarily need TOTL pc's
So all my 3 partitions will go?
if you want to dual boot there should be an "intall alongside" option
a guy is trying to tell me he can force an attack into my computer with 3500 ports
ok
I've sudo cp'd a directory of stuff from an ntfs partition to my ubuntu drive and now I don't have perm's to access the files. is it normal to need to chmod -r after having copied from an ntfs volume?
if you copy with sudo, yes
ok. that's what I'd assumed. what perm level should I chmod to? 775?
you need to *chown*
I'm looking to add two users during the automated install. It looks like you can only add one, unless I'm missing something
can you tell us purpose of this also and ubuntu version?
Well, it's a desktop but I'm running a couple of eggdrops that use sql on it.. Hence the necessity to install libmysqlclient-dev
Ah, i have seen this a couple times lately, kinda slow right now you just need the right people to see it.
i know. where do i get help with my problem
depends on your problem
howd do i go about setting that up
[URL]
thanks
but keep in mind this sort of thing will intrinsically risk resulting in slowing down your connection.
sorry how?
gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
thanks
the instructions on setting default are in the file you are editing
i was just providing that info for cafuego
I thought you where asking about it - the channels moving too fast - sorry
lucky for you, i accept apologies in cash or money order :)
you can have moth filled wallets
no. ubuntu 16.04
perhaps the #kubuntu guys might know some package?
this is really dumb. I put the launcher in /usr/share/applications and it's still not present in "open with" view all applications. how do people associate programs with file types on ubuntu?. without hacking out a stupid XML file for each and every single one
[URL]
my application that I want to associate doesn't show up in the list. like I just said. 10 seconds ago. and for some RIDICULOUS reason... ubuntu doesn't have a browse option. like windows
calm down mate.  wich app are we talking about?
why does it matter?. it's a portable app. i copied the launcher into /usr/share/applications
the more info you give us, the better we can help you
it takes some cpu power to setup all the new packages does it not ?
you could be running a CRAY with 200 CPUs an 40Tb of RAM on a 28.8Kbps modem and it'd update slower, but te cray is several billion times faster than your system.  once its down its all the cpu, but the vast bulk of time is usually downloading
how
sudo apt-get install winetools.  then just run winetools in a terminal.  it will walk you through the setup process
I'm not exactly sure. It happened when I installed WINE from the software center. At the bottom of the pastebin it shows the deb files that cause errors while processing.
why did you mention you disabled software sources?
I saw an error message that said to try disabling third party repositories and running apt-get install -f..  it did't really seem to help
pastebin: dpkg -l '*:i386' | grep '^ii'
13.04 and [URL]

so what would you recomend to make unity run?
try the installer, your GPU is listed in the list of chips

command not found.  dhclient maybe?
oops yes , dhclient
ok, there was a response on pan0 and eth0
try iwconfig
that gives. "no wireless extensions". on lo, pan0, and eth0
thinking you lost your wifi card driver
but it doesn't show up on lspci either.  I downloaded the driver from hp and did modprobe wl. it didn't complain. but I think this means the device is truly borked. :/
laptop ?
yep
dual boot with windows. ?
yes.  and the problem DID start when I rebooted into windows for the first time.  (windows 7)
ok, is your wifi workonhg in windows , at least we'll know if the HW actually works
nope, same response there -- no driver, no device foudn
no device found in windows ,  ?
right
uhoh
:/ how weird that the moment it crapped out coincided with the windows reboot. really made me think it was software. there's no low-level port address list that can get mangled that would affect both the linux and the windows partitions?
use the pc you are using and download the windows driver to a usb stick or some removable device and install it on the windows side of your laptop
well, I'm on ethernet on the laptop. will that work?
then if the wifi chipset doesn't work we'll know for sure.
yes
have you enabled remote desktop on her computer?
not yet. not that I know of
well you need to do that first, then you can connect with the Remote Desktop Viewer
I had to get the source headers, but even giving the instaler the path of the headers, the installer cant find them
dosemu is in the repos
tritum: I did too, but its not hardware accelerated, or at elast I cant find how to enable acceleration
what's wrong with the ubuntu packages?. yes, it. is hardware accelerated
tritum, I beleive you, but I am having a difficult time getting it the card to act like it:).  the fps rates are so low I wonder if im using an old CL
that's odd - it's accelerated for me.  I'll be back...
yeah tried that too, but like the webserver feature in freevo
did you install mythweb?
: Why its not supported?
I said "see if its IS supported"
: I saw for another linux dist.. I couldt see for ubuntu
check if it is supported in Linux - not any distro - in Linux
But how do i find out the package name ?
Whats the software you want to install?
[URL]
TomBoy?
Alright will try once Im back home thanks  :)
press F6
F6 not e?
you're welcome.  gui way, cli way ... as you wish
Or was it tab I cant recall XD
both
Just a curiosity what does nomodeset do exactly?
disable any graphic driver.  use the bios mode
how come there are so many?. how do i remove them
the kernel does a lot of things. You don't remove them, they run your system.
tnanx a lot...what should i do to let them work? i installed vidalia and tor...but im not sure bout their configuration....
Usually, there are two parts. 1) Start Vidalia. 2) Configure the applications you want to "anonymize" (Firefox for example)
vidalia onion is green, i have torbutton for firefox too but when i turn it on no page will open.  i'd like to anonymize firefox
Does it say "Timed out" or "Connection refused" or something else?
firefox now says e to add an exception.  tell me if my english is not clear...im italian =)
What address you're trying to open?
google...but the problem is with every site...my router one too
All sites ask to add an exception?
yes
Even non-SSL ones? (without https://)
may u give me an exemple?
[URL]  That one really should _not_ ask for an exception :/
Cool, I've been getting acquainted with wine. I'll check that out now, thanks!
You're in luck. Starcraft has a gold rating in the Wine AppDB, as does Starcraft II - if you want to run those, they should be fine too. The AppDB is well worth checking up on. For RTS, Warzone 2100 seems pretty popular.
hmmm, do you know when the server version will be released considering the desktop has been released as beta
you mean the beta?.  #ubuntu+1 yes server and other flavors as well
yeah, I can't find the link for the server version
check the topic in #ubuntu+1 please the channel for lucid support and discussion
why? out of interest
man service
thanks.
thats terminal based thouhg
that's ok. I hope configuration is not that though
the only thing that is goofy is specifying your card in the config.
hm, I'll try to read the manual :)
if not there are gui apps. Like ap radar etc....
okay noworries then :p. how about getting rtorrent to start in a "screen" ?. on boot
screen has an option for what command to run
yes....the thing that has the bouncing icons and large when you highlight them
CaptainOblivious : http://www.gnome-[URL].  : ohh you want a launcher bar.  : i use gdesklets and starter bar.  : sudo apt-get install gdesklets
here is the description [URL]
!update > wolfeySI
what do u mean ??
i'm trying to get more details on your question, because the way you asked it doesn't make a lot of sense.  what do you mean by "reboot inside ubuntu"
i am not starting from scratch
then search for tools to check and fix your master boot record / partition table
Some tools are very good and can help people that know about them a lot. But they may get people that don't know how to use them well into trouble :). So currently in whatever I'm doing, I'm also respecting KISS as much as I can...
I wouldn't hesitate to say people should use the default LVM settings, regardless of skill level or knowledge. but they shouldn't touch LVM directly or indirectly if they don't know what they're doing ;). indeed Ubuntu installs as LVM by default now, doesn't it?
No, afaik it doesn't
Oh. Hmm. I wonder why I have that misconception then
not really, I just want to write once and copy, some kind of tracking system
you mean a customized install ?
I really wish I knew how to custom package my own apps and make a repository. like openssh-server, specify blowfish encryption for all the machines I maintain
you could easly implement that with a script. that you could run after install. on all your systems. or you can use something like, [URL]/
got no idea
ok.. i guess i just have to wait for somone at the forum to post then :( .. my server will be down i guess.. heh.. :-/
either that or upgrade to breezy like I have :)
that is a sollution.. but what happens to my old system then? will i keep all my settings?
should do.  if you reinstall you won't.  unless its on a separate partition
dang... then i need this to work.. heh.. i have made sooo many settings..
I was going to say mount it using a live cd
i run a gallery for a lot of users.. i have 11000 picutres in that gallery.. quite high traffic too...
mount the hdd and transfer it somehwere
yes.. but that wont help me get it up running again.. but that way i can maybe save whats on the hd anyway...  yes..
yeah thats all you can do if you need it urgently
if i reinstall i prolly use another hdd.. then i just plug this old one in and mount it and transfer all the stuff.. but there will still be a lot of work.. :-/
a wildcard subdomain, for a wordpress installation
you need to edit the dns servers that host your domain then
I'm doing it locally
then you need to edit your dns servers
which brings me back to my original question
what dns servers are you running ?
whatever comes preinstalled
none
why
Regular user can't set tty speed
oo ok atomic :D. ill check it out
Keytouch might not be what you're looking for. I thought you mean a key combination to one key.
blue goto system>preferences>startup programs and deselect the screensaver app
there is no screensaver app.
really? what version are you on?
10.04 (64 bit)
because i just checked mine and it is right there
10.04 64 bit.
do you have smooth transitions between tracks?
define smooth :). like cross fading?
yeah well not necessarily smooth as in faded, but do you get this "silent -> 0.5s bit of strange noise -> new track starts" sort of thingie? :P
I have no strange noise. just track end -> silence switching to new song -> new song
it goes to silent first, and then it plays just a bit from the end of last track, as it would flush buffer or something. could be my ancient cpu tho :P
which rhythmbox do y ou use... the standard one?. rhythmbox-gstreamer. ?
0.8.8 that came with ubuntu hoary..so i suppose its standard
strange... probably something to do with the buffering indeed. have it with other players as well?
nope, xmms works fine
and if you queue 2 files in totem?
hmm, i'll try that totem, sec.  works fine with totem
thats also gstreamer. so likely just an issue w/rhythmbox
i tried to look for buffer settings in rhythmbox but either they are hidden evry well or i'm blind.  yep, guess so..too bad, i like the itunes media library ripoff ;)
hehe... yea.... though amarok (KDE based) is also quite nice
synaptic?. i went to their page and noting about wine??
yes. system---synaptic.  in taskbar
in system you hawe preferences and administration
search in administration
ok i got it. but i hawe more packages/data with wine
click on it, put your pass in, after that in search field write wine
but hw fast is it?. must be slow I assueme
Well with USB3 it is pretty damn fast... Faster than a crypted internal laptop harddisk.
oh I see. so then you have to get a usb 3.0 hd in order to get the speed benefits right?
And you can put /tmp and /swap to RAM to limit write cicles and to speed up the system.
ok. cool
Yes you need compatible hardware. I can recommend the SAN Disk extreme 64GB stick.
you gave me the idea of altering the desktop image in python and execute it on startup. that'll do the trick
oh, are you looking for something like bginfo does in windows? I see.. !apparmor
not detected
Not to be rather curt here, but...use another usb mouse?
no joy :-/.  and it works in the desktop
jileean: Plugging in another usb mouse doesn't work?
As well as my modems. But one of my modems doesn't show.
well it's probably a winmodem.
It's not a winmodem, it's a USB adsl modem. It works fine, but it doesn't show there.
well, it's not perfect..  wait, adsl?
Yes, ATM.
when you say 'modem' we take that to mean '56k modem'
all my servers are still on 12.04. do-release-upgrade still says "no new releases". [URL]

Creativity? Is that legal?
not in the united states
Oh, good.
in the u.s. its patented
how do i do that
what are you booting from ?
say i wanna know the name of the helping bots of #ubuntu?.  in general
there isn't a 100% sure way of finding out
okay. Im a bit late on that. I used the apt-get. but for future reference
lol, whichever you prefer then
So is xorg ... :-)
IMHO, setting up Xorg is more complicated than setting up a softraid.
slart: thanks
you can do this when you reboot.. when you get the boot menu to chose from different options.  I think you press 'e' to edit at that point
google, or possibly synaptic
I didn't find anything in synaptic.... There was GNUPod_perl
/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__.py' in '/usr/share/command-not-found' <-- how to get rid of this bug?. /usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__.py' in '/usr/share/command-not-found' <-- how to get rid of this bug? it should only say COMMAND NOT FOUND not that error
ok
the thing is, that I have no idea what file exactly to watch.
or watch -n1 -d "tail /var/log/messages"
gnome-system-log provides a fairly nice view usually.
what is it you want to find ?
I would like to know what makes gnome-system-log so slow..  I suspect it is a huge log file..  which is also reducing my harddisk space..  possibly noticably, I don't know.
have you tried using the disk usage reporter on /var/log ?.  Applications > Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer
hv u use the asteriskgui too?
the web gui?
yes
sure, thats how you configure it
that is where I hv the problem
whats the problem?
how can i chech that?. Guardin... I think not... but YES the msg say so... I think it is something with the Net config.... Afther I set static ip... I did not come in.... "GDM could not write the authorization file... This could mean that your are out of disk space or that your home directory could not be opened for writing. In any case, It is not possible to long in. Please contact your administrator"
well first ensure you have enough disk space. df should show you that. hello
Good point... Usage 100 %
so your full :(
How to emty trash?. I deleted many files...
you may have to delete more files
tftpd-hpa.... at least, I think so. /var/log/daemon.log:Feb 9 13:21:11 localhost in.tftpd[4151] : cannot set groups for user nobody.  am I right that I should interpret that as. "explicitly add user nobody to the nogroup line in /etc/group ?
afaik the account should be on the system, I am running Warty and don't have that account/croup either.  err account/group
thank you, .  MY X session fails so I have to do a startx from shell :( how do I fix this?
startx works?
Its not working now. Saying X is already running
did you make any update/install/remove ?
i havent fiddled with the bios since i set the machine up last year
So check it... there's nothing to say the nvram/CMOS settings weren't affected when the system failed
k, im looking at the bios now, everything seems to be on "auto".  i can try setting to lba ?
Error 18 indicates that GrUB is being asked to seek to a cylinder number larger than the BIOS can address, so if the MBR and stage 1.5 files are okay, the BIOS is the only other issue.  Yes, try that!
k ... will the disk still work even though i installed the OS in normal mode?. well scratch that, still error 18
Shouldn't make any difference - Linux does its own disk handling, only GrUB needs the BIOS since there's no kernel at that point
if I have glibc installed
!info libc6.  ^
I've only ever used apt-get
aptitude had a little problem supporting multi-arch, but that is solved. !aptitude. well well to apt they say
ok. how dow you cend mail in it
man mailx. mailx -s "Subject" recpient@[URL]. then type message, and end with ^D
than you man
You're welcome.
isn't there a graphical tool for this in 7.10?
probably somewhere i never bothered looking for it
can you go to System-. Preferences -> MMS.  and test your microphone, i'm trying to figure out what expected behaviour is
What is MMS?
multi media selector. sorry multimedia systems selector
Exactly what is it you are trying to do?
my microphone doesnt work
Is your mic not working?
right
Are the levels turned up? Or is it muted?
i've installed the latest alsa.  cranked
cranked ?
If i go to applications->sound & video->sound recorder it errors out.  levels are turned up
Turn your audio volume up and the mic level up and tap on the mic and see if you hear it through the speakers.
I don't hear it. i can play music. youtube etc
Does your speakers work?
works fine, i can play music fine
Check to see that the mic is plugged into correct port.
built in mic
This is a laptop?
yes
Open a terminal window and type alsamixer and hit enter.
ok, everything is turned to the max.  however, i can now open the sound recorder, but when i record and playback, it just plays an annoying beep the whole time...
Is the sound card correctly identified at the top of the screen?
yes
Hit the right arrow repeatedly until you get to Mic.
I've done that, all levels are maxed out
Do you see the MM at bottom of the Mic collum?
I do
Is it highlighted? (Hit the letter m to toggle back and forth.)
it is now highlighted
If the MM is highlighted, that means the Mic is muted.
it is now a highlighted 00
00 means it is tuerned all the way down. Hit the up arrow to turn it up.
hmm, its 00, but its all the way up to two bars of red
Do you also see Mic Select ?
I don. t see mic select
Try and change, maybe what it is on now is for the external Mic. Plug in an external Mic and see.
dont have an external mic
You may need to mute or turn off another input device.
ah, that sounds likely
00 at the bottom indicates that it is turned down or dissabled..  Did you try turing up the Mic?
mic is turned all the way up, i dont know how to get it off of 00
Is your audio chip correctly identified? Which one is it?
Realtek ALC883
Turn the master channel down, open another terminal and type cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp and then trun up master enough so that you can hear the noise.
happens around 6.  i just hear static
Ctrl-c to stop it.
yup
Ok, well not sure why the Mic is not working. You don't have a port for an external Mic?.  Is your system fully updated?
i have a port, just no mic, I upgraded to 10.04 about 1 month ago
Well, find an external Mic someplace and test it to see if that is the active Mic port.
I bet thats it.  how would i change that?
I don't know..  May not be able to.
ah, but what I need is for the eject key on my keyboard to work for both opening and closing the drive, like in OS X. I don't have enough keys to map eject -t as well as eject.
I was asking whether eject -t worked because I wasn't sure whether the tray-close function of the drive was controllable from software on your system
it does work
then it is certainly possible to have the key work as a toggle
so nvidia drivers require 386 and 686 wont work ?
some of them do, yes, you are installing a legacy driver it seems
windows 7
Are you familiar with the limitations of primaries in the amount of, on a single HD?
intel integrated on an emachines, heh. :(
mine works just file
Video is working, rather, I have a problem running quicktime videos: there's no audio
mplayer?
??
does "chmod" work?
it works bt i dont know how to use the arguments
man chmod will give you more about that
ok ill try ........thanx dude
welcome
i pressed the power button on the machine
:O. don't do that
e.g. held it for a couple of seconds, since the machine wasn't responsive.  yeah, in hindsight this was a really stupid decision .. .
when you need to emergency override reboot, hold alt and press printscreen (keep holding alt...) SUB with a delay between each letter. S = sync filesystem, U = unmount filesystems, B = force reboot
it's an html file that I want to associate with firefox and it just wont come up
so what have you done so far?
Quake 3
native?
i held shift, grub > recovery mode... worked... and im not sure why it didnt 10 times before that
while good to be able to activate the recovery console, what about ctl+alt+F2 at the login screen ?
Yeah, I'm thinking of that, but something tends to make my neckhairs stand a bit on end about doing it, for some reason. I faintly remember something about "Don't do this" being told me at some point.
I always prepend my advice with disclaimers (unless explicitly told myself to do it at one point) for a reason.. because somehow someone always has a better way
Hee. ;)
Also assuming the permissions on both the link and the actual folder are the same, nothing obviously wrong about that jumps out at me aside from possible standards-noncompliance
what would the text for the sh file look like? i'm not into scripting... i suppose first line as you just said and second line just as my command with out the & at the end?
that it. (and no '"' for my line)
like which?
there are many.. i would start with a web search, or browse something like distrowatch
no - is that worth a shot ?
just as a test what system does.  also try F1 at shutdown process to see text based, whats happening
alright will do that and report back :P
good luck
it does the same and unfortunatly i could not see any textoutputs.  switched off quiet splash and now i got a output
aha
here you go [URL]
not sure why, can you try a shutdown from the guest account?
brightness doesn't work :S. it's stuck at max
I think thats not a driver issue...
acpi_backlight=vendor doesn't seem to work, can't use the Fn keys.  what's the issue then?
is it a desktop?
nope, a laptop. Acer Aspire V5 122P
is it a Dual/Hybrid graphics laptop?
integrated graphics
what driver are you using?
right now fglrx. I've tried fglrx-updates and the one from AMD's website, both didn't make any changes :S
AFAIK using the AMD propritary driver fixes the brightness control issue.... are you using the latest supported kernel? what is the version of fglrx?
err, how do I check which version of fglrx I have?. nevermind, forgot about ccc. ccc says 13.35.1005
try this, [URL]
dd if=/home/gantry/Archive/iso/ubuntu-9.04-netbook-remix-[URL]g of=/dev/sdc1 bs=1M.  with that command
dont use sdc1 use sdc :)
how do I ttell it to stop asking me for an archive mirror
could be that the standard installer does that, if I remember correct you can at least skip it if you select expert install but now I'm not really sure
that easy? hm... thanks :)
man 5 ssh_config
I did alsamixer
and it's ubuntu?
yes it is ubuntu
don't mistype, in terminal: alsamixer
whats loco?
what country are you in?
look
err can't you just tell me?
yeah
i can walk you through it. ok
zykes-, nameserver 192.168.1.1 ...also, I'm on a wireless connection.  that was supposed to be for you
that makes things easy then, it's your router.  can you right click on the network icon on panel and find the settings for your wireless?
I'm there
see a IPv4 Settings tab?
yes,
Method dropdown for Manual
then I just add an IP address? off the top of my head?. I'm there
it will have to be a 192.168.1.X where X is the machine IP.  netmask will be 255.255.255.0 - and gateway 192.168.1.1
so this IP would only apply for my laptop?
yes
how do I find X?
make it up 35 for example
two digits, though?
1-254 are valid
alright,  , did it
in a terminal try "sudo service networking restart" but it will disconnect you from IRC here!!!
what will this do? Also...is this also how I can change the password to the wifi router?
if it doesn't work - set the network back to DHCP/automatic
I know it probably isn't
it will restart your networking and thus switch to your new static settings.  password router - dunno depends on your router
restart: Unknown instance:
are you using karmic?
I am indeed
dunno why that didn't work? guess you can try "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
ah yes, already did that. just now.. showed kded. Why doesn't ps aux -H show this?
btw, long time not seen :)
Hi  :).  be careful, OT is punishable by death. ;-).  so, any idea?. lsof worked. ps doesn't...
sry no idea
Eric^^: testdisk?
yeah sudo apt-get install testdisk
i can do that, but it doesn't allow me to log in to change settings.  i remember having to change a setting in my [URL]nf file before to enable that in ubuntu, but forgot where that is
then your computer is mad at you ;-) I really dont have enough experience with ubuntu yet I am a gentoo user who just switched.  I dont know about logging in and all that yet via cups I did it with gentoo but also consdier that your permissions for logging in may not be set.  check that out actually on the permissions
hm... ok thanks.  any idea why my ssh localhost gives seg fault?
You could have a look at [URL] If it isn't the same as your problem it could at least give you tips on trouble-shooting ssh.
why is it so?
its because there's no proper and stable support for PCI passthrough/hotswapping.. however its best to ask this in virtualbox support channel
display gui or nvidia settings?
In your case nvidia settings, if you use the nvidia restricted driver.
yeah, theyre all visible. ill get xrandr output..
So xrandr wount give you some info either I guess.
so an extended partition allows as many partitions under itself
I don't know as I have never tried it myself, but that is what that thread appears to indicate.  may I ask why you need so many partitions?
yep
ok so you what had a deb package or a source pacakge you compiled?
e.g. dpkg -i [URL]b
ok what is the pacakge name exactly?
floola_4.9-1~[URL]b
ok if this is gnome go to system/administration/synaptic pacakge manager.  hit the "Search" button and type in floola
anything I do with aptitude results in that warning. E.g. aptitude upgrade. i created a /etc/apt/preferences file to pin version 0.9.0~pre1-1 of a package
well. aptitude tells you that "0.9.0~pre1-1" is an invalid version string.
Ok.. I try that.. Thanks..! =). me..?
np, its also a darn good sound editor.  yes, are you looking to do batch conversion?
running X?
I'd prefer to keep it console enviroment only, no graphical desktop at all. Easier with low end hardware
ya I would. How do i do that?
Just choose during installation not to install it. as far as I remember, ubuntu-server installation doesn't even try install it.
No I didnt. Nothing installed. Cant get to install screen. I get the ubuntu boot (1st screen when booting from CD) and then black screen no matter what I do to proceed
Hmmh, download yourself the ubuntu-server image and install it in expert mode, doesn't have so much grahics
I've run Ubuntu Server like a pro in VM enviroments, but this is my first physical box
but your problem sounds more like broken cd :D
second time I've heard the broken CD bit tonight.. I'm installing from a DVD that I burnt.. downloaded image matches checksum
checksum match doesn't mean the disk itself wouldn't be broken or the diskreader. Since you said that server has so crappy graphics card, have to ask : does it even have a dvd-reader or just cd?
I burnt with mac.. let it verify and everything. I'll try again tho. It has DVD reader :)
Do you have option to try with USB-stick?
tell me more about that please
noatime speeds up the disks, add it to all disks, and use noop for the ssd as you want a basic scheduler for it
/ ext4 discard,errors=remount-ro 0 1.  I only got one disk
make it noatime,discard etc etc
will this mount /tmp in RAM?
no
I am in the Computer File Browser.
wait, are you trying to grab linux files from windows? because that is... troublesome
No, I am trying to grab .txt mainly..  But just clicking the drive brings up an error.
what OS are you running right now?
Ubuntu atm.
and the text file is on the windows partition? did you shut down windows correctly?
Yes.
any chance you could try doing it manually using this? [URL]
on 10.04 ?
sure
Exec=/usr/bin/ecryptfs-mount-private
i'm pretty sure that you need to run that command. you are not in a graphical DE ?.  those .desktop files describe an icon
I'm on the command line and I already ran that command.
oh you said you ran ecryptfs-recover-private
I did. And then I went to the directory that it created, and Access-Your-Private-[URL]sktop was in it.
what did /usr/bin/ecryptfs-mount-private output when you ran it?
no more than normal as far as I can tell
What about CPU?
it will reject an incorrect password almost immediately. but if it's a correct one, it will take a solid minute. cpu is normal too, less than 5%
hmm... It's probably the login, then, rather than accepting the password
once it finally logs in, it says "Failed to add entry for user myusername". which is an error message I haven't been able to find much out on yet. all of the stuff I'm finding on it has to do with SAMBA, and I'm not using that, nor do I have it configured
strange.... That's a message from samba..  Probably something to do with the Samba PAM module..  Try this first though... If you type "bash", does it take as long as logging in?
Well, once you re-enforced that it was samba, I removed samba (it apparently was somehow installed after all) and it looks like that's fixed it
Nice
that's what I get for not covering my bases
You need samba though?
not particularly. I'm running a file server on this box, but I don't have any windows boxes. nor am I sure the time will ever come
Well, I guess that's good enough XD
did u compile this feature?
i'm new to linux i don't know anything about that :(
is there a way to do it with the command prompt?
sure there is, but i never used it, sorry.  try this: metacity --replace
how?
- i PMed you a link
do we still have the menu.xml touched?
yes
ps auxxxxxx and grep for the running xfce process, lets attach to it using strace -c -p [pid] and then use the menu. Lets see where it looks at there..  It is going to be later today until I get time to deploy this local, baby wakes in 10min or so.
OK will do.  Should I attach to the xfce-panel or xfce-session?
try the panel first, I am assuming.. yay, drm.. wait for html5
Here the panel attach (I just clicked on the apps menu, and opened a submenu0.  I'm going to try to attach to the xfce4 session, and I'll paste that too
okie, cool
Here's when attached to the session: [URL]
touch a ~/test.xml. and in xfce menu properties, choose "use custom menu file" and choose the blank test.xml. then lets check that strace
-- ok one sec.  [URL]  Still nothing with xml
this is awesome.. I have to run off, the cry is among me. I am going to deploy this in the lab in around 2 hours, send me an e-mail at  at gnu dot org if I detach so we can stay in touch. This may be a pretty big bug.
Thanks a bunch for the help.  I'll be around late. r
Block size alignment optimizes the use of blocks by preventing using, say, 1.0001 blocks (two blocks) to store data
oh ... hmm, are you trying to install ubuntu on a machine that has windows, and you need to shrink the windows partition?
I'm using "Try Ubuntu" from USB
so with no changes, just a booted live you have this issue?
yes
Great, thanks that is helpful for the channel to know, have you tried a mouse to confirm whether tap is working?
I was downloading a game that has two cd, the first cd installed fine, but when I tried to install the second it said cd no found. I typed thta address in and found the file but still read the same things
please use "winecfg", and go to the drives tab. Is your CD ROM drive listed?
ok what do I do, type that in terminal ?
Yes.
ok hold for a sec let me try.  it says z drive and c
Looks like your CD drive is not listed..  Try choosing "autodetect"
for "windows" is it possible to install gtk theme on windows ?. for MS Windows
you could add a windows theme on the server side, then use that
how can I do that ?
install a theme like you would normally, then use the guide I just linked toname the theme
I m currently using windows 8 there are many themes already present by default now how to tell xserver(windows version) to tell which theme to use ?
install a theme, then set it as in the link I gave, see how this page says "raleigh" that is the theme being used: [URL]
i have been trying for about 4 hours to get a gba emulator.... i apt-getted visualboyadvance. cant find any examples of how to make that load roms, i know its command line but i dont NEED a gui. i tried gnomeboyadvance, VBA-Frontend, qtVBA, VBA-Express.... gnomeboy gives python parse errors, the others wont make and qtVBA is arsed
sorry no clue. did you try looking on their web site?
yes, no documentation ANYWHERE
visualboyadvance that is
anyone here us visualboyadvance from command line?.  nothing on any of em, including there.  perhaps you can help with general make errors then ^^ i paste them
im at about the end of my battery life
ok :(
try synaptic for any dependencies
anyone then, i get this error with gnomeboyadvance [URL] i have them all ^^. or this error message in VBAEXPRESS [URL]
whats the osX in line 5?
already done :-)
Then make sure your user is added to the vboxusers group.
also already done :-)
Is the guestadditions iso installed as well?. [URL] for example.
my dist. is installed on an HD
If your hd is sda and you have no other volumes, that should be right
sda = ?
What do you see if you do an ls /dev/sd*
/dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda5 /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1
yeah, so I'd guess that sda1-5 are your HD, and sdb1 would be the flash drive
good enough for me... here goes ;)
If you're running desktop gnome you should be able to figure it out from running mount -l
you nailed it. Thanks much
mount -l will show you where everything's mounted. Anyone know if there's a way to keep audio playing out of X11 apps when you switch over to a virtual terminal?
yup
do you get the grub menu?
no - error before that
what's the error?
something like "error loading operating system"
is your /boot directory on the raid?
terminal allowed me to proceed with installation without authentication which is where software center was stoping installatino. installed, thanks for the help
and did you use sudo apt-get install xchat
yes :D
ok and did it install
i believe so. yes it installed
ok cool then it should be under Applications / Internet
great... now how I burn a CD :(
you'll have to use another burner or copy those files to a usb device or the harddrive even and burn them later
actually.. I just installed Dungeons of Dredmore via steam via wine, no sound..
Do you have sound from other sources?.  Or have you tried yet?
nope
hmm. know anybody with a shine?. CU720
fat32
that's not going to work
oups
partition it and then format it
I can't see it in gparted. it's stuck on that searching thing
sudo cfdisk /dev/mmcblk0
ok so I create new partition from free space?. the problem is that the disk is 64gb and I only see it as 6134mb
do you see another partitoin taking up the other 58GB
aliases are in modules.d I think. let me check. modprobe.d even. yeah they are in /etc/modprobe.d
Ah, great
whatcha installing?. probably pop3
Going to try IrDA
10.04
install the latest version of hplip from the hp website.  then it will work, trust me
can you add/remove songs on an ipod with amarok?
I think so, but I don't know how it works, I run rockbox on my ipod, and my library is in .ogg so I don't really use a program to transfer songs
and is it a dual gpu optimus thing.
optimus? no idea
!info nvidia-current. optimus is on many new laptoos
ok. I am stuck on boot can i break this like i can under windoze f5/f8?
ok but i have tried it and the dvd wont boot. i guess my boot order isnt right but it should be cd first be default right?
yes. or there sohuld be a button to press to choose something to boot from. rather than messing with the boot order. it can. i only have the hdd in my boot list. and use the f8 to choose devices to boot from
ok ill give it a try thanks
you can disable ipv6 if you never use it with a boot line
I get all the other information but the kernal version still says No LSB modules are available.  I get all the other information but the kernal version still says No LSB modules are available
i believe that's "normal"
ok. hum. Oh nevermind i am totally wrong with what i am doing.  I ment to do uname -r
glad you figured it out :)
multi repos
!info xbmc.  no such package.  perhaps you mean a 3rd party repo or PPA
3rd party repo
contact them
heh :(
i suggest u come back later when gmt 0 is around 9pm
Thanks, will definitely come back ;]
maybe someone then is well educated to do that
mm.. you mean you never needed this feature? sometimes i just want to scroll to a different position just for a short while to look something up. but then i want to return immediately without having to search for the original position.
In those cases I end up using Find (usually Ctrl+f) or PgUp/Dwn instead of the scrollbar
my think pad doesn't say what exaxt model it is but it is a iseries type 1161. and i think it is a 1300
hang on a sec
no, the program gnome-art
try the tmp folder
Also, is there a way to get rid of the bars ont he side of my task bars?
those are the hide buttons, look in preferences
yeah, but there are still bars there after I remove those.
try xkill ina terminal and the cursor turns to a skull and crossbones, they click the taskbar with it. they = then. it will refresh
that just kills X. and restarts.. They are moving buttons.
nope. try killall gnome-panel ina terminal. KI4KL, you do use gnome right?
from here: [URL] ?
Yes, both times from there, 10.10 non LTS
how did you install it to your usb?
on the third line of the error I get, xor: automatically using best checksuming function: PIII_SSE.  once using unetbootin and another time with Quniversal usb installer"
yes.
^jay2^: How large is the hard drive?. ^jay2^: In GB
seagate 80gb
Maybe Ubuntu doesn't like Seagate drives?
is there any way to fix?.  or at least diagnose further
Are you using k3b ?
no, i'll install it
you may also want to try "cdrecord -scanbus" in the console and see what output you get
an amd. I've noticed more people have trouble with ATI cards. Sorry, meant to say ATI :)
good luck. I'm on ATI, I have dual monitors working, but it took me 3 solid weeks and quite literally breaking my [URL]nf to do it
haha. :/. ...Share your xorg? :p. I have two LCD's, one is bigger then the other (wide screen) .. if atleast for now I could get the resolutions correct (right now the widescreen is kind of wonky) then that'll work until I get dual working
I can give you my xorg, but part of the config is in the Catalyst Control center, and you have to reset the thing every boot. Plus, it only works with one orientation, and with 1280x800 + 1280x1024 resolutions.  to be perfectly honest, I'm STILL not sure how I got it working
ah well then it's probably best you not share and confuse me. haha. So you're using which drivers?
the restricted ones, the ones that do 3d well
Cause I tried using the other ones...err can't remember name atm, but they made my card constantly run the fan even with nothing happening so that kind of sucked
envy?
Nah..started with an 'f'. (that's helpful eh?)
fglrx?
yes
of course. just remove them. via software center or the terminal
i made a mistake and wrote up a script to add a shit ton of programs for a specific set of uses... now no longer have the script and a shit ton of packages i dont need that are now causing issues with deps on other stuff
what *buntu are you on?
gnome. 16.04. no... .10
so you have ppas I take it?
thanks
If you just need the actual charge values, cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT?/state
fighting with combat wireless actually. and getting the unknown symbol error
cat /proc/version
lolz. thanks
That what you needed?
yep
very good
cool, any idea where to get help with crashes?
they have a page at [URL]
Marcelo: I am getting no such file or directory. even ls user/bin does not work
it almost certainly means you have not installed it. Try to download it from the google web site and install from command line, i have already done that.
I will give that a shot. Thanks
you have to put a "/" in front of like /usr/bin.
Thanks, and when I'm installing xp it says to format the image file, so doesnt matter if I choose NTFS or FAT right?
Choose NTFS anyway
well, i think i've installed it as a standalone; I have this big FAT 32 partition, and.... i successfully copied your link, . i,m tryin' to do this just from inside grub.exe
never used grub4dos, sorry
i did make then make install and got that error. yeh
did you ./configure first?
awesome/fluxbox provides panels, I reckon?
possible
unfortunately neither of those window managers suite me well
kernel starts killing processes
So "no".
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk (or jre)
ok thanks, also, is there any specific default port?
default port is 22, but your SSH clients will know that and default to that.
thanks do u use this personally and is it good.  i dont wanna screw my ipod
thousands of linux users use it.  i dont have an ipod, would you send me a nano to see how gtkpod works? :)
did you read about the password file?
yup, thx.  running the config prog now
yeah, think so
if vlc won't play it, I don't know
vlc, hmm, does that come installed in Ubuntu already?
not by default no
lol. Actionparnsnip- i did that
Baker: the arch is moot
the arch is moot?
Baker: then you have the resolution

im really newbie to ubuntu. just installed yesterday
Baker: in plan terms, the fact you are using 64bit is of zero co
zcat ubuntu is very simple what you are trying to do is hard thats a fact
Consequence to the situation
zero o?. lol five years ago
Baker: typo
true.. i guess recognized would be better
ok - there is no recognized, it will depend on situation needs and approach - which is normally put in place by experience
SWEET!. pena and pad ready to take notes
just move them to wherever they should be.  typically a Wine filesystem will start in ~/.wine/
move them? in windows or move them in ubuntu or neither???
you can put stuff almost anywhere with ln -s real/location fake/location, though.  copy from Windows to Ubuntu
okay, im gonna go install. thanks everyon. *everyone
real easy
hmm, someone should change that on there then.. :o
i have changed the wiki, several people had probs with unstable....i have no access to the website cms to change it there, i'll contact someone.....
ok ill try to find them

flare183: typing that will give me prompts to change my password?
just be sure your logged into the user that you want to change the password for..  Yup
the volume bar is showing that something is happening on the headphone port
I am now on manjaro gnome, and I had some issues with some games in steam regarding pulseaudio, Using alsa may fix your problem. Those games were same, they appeared but had no sound. You have to debug it, maybe get an error message hopefully
@ yeah i've got ffmpeg up to date
i probably cannot help much then, but what are your woes?
IDK how to call, just let the laptop sleep.. So it doesn't shut down.
yes it should be in the admin menu area somewhere.  look for 'power', etc.
ok but now how do i eject it?
eject /dev/cdrom.  use sudo if that doesn't work
it gets stuck
define "stuck"
hmm does it work like that ?
if you want 4+GB files for a video that could be converted to avi at 1/2 the size... yes.
thanks will have a look
well i couldn't install it. since everything on my system is broken
hm . i'm searching for kind a archive and google finds that for me .
i don't remember a pool under Ubuntu... only Debian... but i could be wrong
gparted and fdisk can't create a new partion table on it. i also tried dd=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
does sudo fdisk -l show that it is present?
Yes it show two partions
how are you running gparted or fdisk?
sudo parted / sudo fdisk. or should i su?
sudo is fine
where do i find the man page
'man cabextract'
how do i extract using the console?
please read the man pages
i want to login to my machine using SSH, and specifying the credentials... Atm its wanting a SSH pubkey and not letting me in if i don't have one.
then just create a pubkey with ssh-keygen?
no I want to disable the setting so i dont need ssh keys to login.. can you help ?
put the sshd_config of the server into a pastebin
ok
maybe PasswordAuthentication is deactivated (?).  if you think the config is messed up somehow, you could also try purging and reinstalling the openssh-server package.
never mind, wrong channel
k
had problems doing it the expected ways
gparted
with 10.10 ?
it will have to install the restricted extras drivers but thats automated
okie, thank you
yep np
the client, yes, but a frontend?
[URL]  i'm talking about a graphikal version.  it's not a frontend to the text-based program, it's an entirely different program
lsb_release -d
there you go. ()
thanks
-a option will give release number and a little more info
nop. 5.10 i guess
there was a problem with the installer >> [URL]

is there a text based installer on that cd ?
nop..I'm not using beta. I'm using 5.10 amd64. Hey . looks like it worked the second time. I rebooted and repeated
sweet :).  Dapper is awesome :)
ffs.  don't send that thing to me again
okay i'll only do it like 3 more times. !away > mumbles-off
Was it about kick or kickban?
kickban. with a kick you can rejoin immediately
So, what about kickban?
and will do so if you have autojoin enabled. kickban you cannot, generally speaking

i amusing a notebook
what sort of notebook
an acer aspire 93303 amd turion 64x2 1,6 ghz .....  aber alt+f1 i see at the end no resume image, doingnormal boot
That is quite normal. Is this problem occuring immediately after first boot, or did it start happening after an update?
i dont now what u mean. it isnt my first boot. i wanted to set my webcam. someone said that i have to install somethin like kde-dev after installation my kubuntu doesnt boot. just a little bit till the logo.  trying to resume from /dev/disk/by-uuid/..... and no resume image, doing normal boot....
right, ignore the normal boot/resume stuff. Thats normal. Try a reinstall.
where is that setting? im using nvidia ion platform
start nvidia control panel and i had it at a tab below the temp meters
i tried to remove /dev/.udevdb and reboot, but got same error
hum

xgl support is in #ubuntu-xgl
thanks bro!

it's not that the problem.  it tells me: this file is not a wmv file as stated by the extension, it's a asf file, rename it or (for security) I can't start your player; translation from italian version.  both wmv & asf are played regularly by mplayer
hmm that happened also to me some time ago. Have you tried to rename the file from wmv to asf?
person is me. and machine is a p4. oh btw, is there a kernel argument i could pass to tell it not to try to run X server?. except "single"?. yeah. how? :). ok, "single" will work for now :).  what is the way? :)
patience mostly
ps aux |grep executable_filename.  let's say i'm patient :))
X is actively being worked on
do i just install packages manually ignoring the unsatisfied dependencies?
use something like aptitude or synaptic
synaptic doesn't work in console, i guess ;)))
no, but aptitude does
Just fooling arround with virtualization. Web Server reqs in mind...
desktop or server (i.e. does the machine have a GUI)?
server, headless
personally I'd use kvm then, assuming the server supports VT
Yes I tend to go for kvm.. I like linux as a hypervisor. How about xen integration and support in ubuntu?
not great
flash
unetbootin
my usb flash drive has 352MB of storage, will it fit?
bit too small try 1gb
yea win 7 efi i am using kubuntu triple boot with kali linux. it recognizes kali but not win7
do you have win7 installed on a different disk?
: kali and kubuntu on /dev/sdb and win7 /dev/sda
is it possible to change the boot medium to boot win 7?
: at the moment i just use the bios.  : but would be nice to have win7 on grub
perhapse this will work: [URL]
yes
mkfs.vfat
pelo, will data dvd option work?
yes
how do i get my mx5000 desktop to work with ubuntu?
It should work automatically.
it doesnt i dont know what to do. im a beginner obviously
We get lots of beginners, that's no problem. Do you have the receiver plugged into the USB port?
yes.  why ? is it not possiable ?
Check /cdrom/.
ahh ok thx
Note that if you used dd, rather than a tool like Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator or Unetbootin, then you won't be able to write to the USB drive as it has a read only (iso9660) filesystem.
ok. thanks i'm going to give it a try
then Add and hopefully it just finds it :).  Make sure it's on.  plugged in, etc
yes sir i did
It worked/found it ?
well i clicked on add printer and clicked on USB and nothing happened. this is not ubuntu though it is Mx-14 linux
wrong channel then :)
sorry it was an on-join code. i'll change it
turn it off
hook: I'm guessing that was for somebody else?
yep.. sorry.
How do I play movies on DVD such as Iron Man in Ubuntu?
what have you tried?
I have installed ubuntu-restricted-extras
I'd assume it'd play in "Move Player". Movie*
should I choose "no configuration", "internet site".... "internet with smarthost", or "satellite system" ?. !postfix
got here it tells you what to do ;). sdort of
would yo choose "no configuration" or "satellite system"?
do you really plan on using it?
is it only possible in hoary
ok :). i like it
I was trying to use the tarball but I get a frustrating error which I could resolve when I ran ./configure on the mailnotification tarball. thats why I was looking for an apt-get. it was always complaining of the GTK+ although I had installed 2.6
ah, ok
Is the apt-get for mailnotification only usable on hoary
that I don't know...but probably the dependencies are hoary specific
nope
erm than you will need an external drive? a pen drive would do
I'll pass
hmmm ok
there isn't anything obvious in that file
well, you have to learn to read it. It's definitely complaining about something. Alternatively, you can read the configure script to figure out what it's doing.
I need to use active directory authentication, so before I can mount using samba I need to be able to authenticate. k :)
yeah i realised that. i am not good enough on ad
pinning..hm..  what program lets me pin a package?
man apt_preferences will give you more details
oaky, thanks :)
you might also apt-get install apt-howto, and read through some of it
sorry what? its public, and someone from beijing china with a static ip.. umm maybe i should check my security? lol
is that interface connected to the internet? expect random traffic
here's a paste.. u think its just random or he actually made a connection? [URL]
this is the reason why firewalls are created to prevent the background radiation of the internet from turning your computer into a botnet
I've tried the --title param but it doesn't seem to work,
hm.
--title=TEST or --title="TEST"
check how your default terminal handles titles, if it is forcing it not to use the title or something - or better yet, do a new profile
yeah. though it should tell you that, especially for the newbs like me
tail -f /var/log/syslog , you should see some messages when you doubleclick and enter your password.  that is, type the /var/log/syslog
yes. from root terminal not from the music player
and with nautilus?
no
without root acces...
Well I recently updated from dapper to edgy and azureus now says No SSL provider available. so I dunno
hmmm, try sudo apt-get remove azureus
can I SSH into it or somehow have it automatically configure the IP??.  I have the Ubuntu install CD
is the ssh server running?
it was installed during OS install, but It's my first time using Ubuntu and it's a brand new install.  in other words, I don't know..  I wish there was a way I could find out it's IP..  if it has one
connect a monitor/keyboard
I'm stuck on one of the steps
which ones
I've installed dmraid, and used fdisk to create partitions on the array. but when I try to mkfs, it says the partitions do not exist
what command are you using exactly
I'm using mkfs.ext? (?=2/3) -t /dev/mapper/sil_aiabbjceffca1. it doesn't work with ext2 or ext3
you just want mkewfs -j /dev/md0
i have no idea, i mean it just hung for a few seconds while i removed openssh-server, it never did that before. somethings just not right with it. heh
open a terminal, run the command 'dmesg' and put all of the output in a pastebin
[URL]
it's more likely to be related to vmware than anything else
i would like to know what the "filesystem has been mounted more than 30 times without being checked, check forced"
it means exactly what it says
well it was working fine till someone in here told me to stop vmware while trying to write dvds/cds.  then the result of that was "non-contigous 13.1%" or something like that, it had them words
every time you mount a filesystem, it increases a bit of info on the disk. you can run 'sudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda1' to see the info that's stored about the disk, including 'Mount count'. a number that high (13.1%) is a bit of a worry. it should have automagically run 'fsck' for you to check and fix errors
: I can drag it to increase the column wide but not decrease
It probaby won't go smaller than the largest entry for that column, in some cases.
: nope , only 1 file was in it and the name was as short is "test"
What column are you trying to resize?. There is a minimum width, it appears to be just a bit bigger than the column title width.
yes, indeed.
crap my vnc into my friends linux box died, i'm afraid someone else wil have to help. sorry :(
thanks anyway. I have a sneaking suspicion I'm missing some essential packages. I'll figure it out.
quick thought, try: stat /usr/bin/X11/X (or something in that area)
good idea.
maybe you don't have a symlink
doesn't quite work.... i am trying on firefox...
you can do most everything with a keyboard, but firefox is not gnome ;(.  Fujitsu is right, wrong tab reversal.
i dont fallow?. it just change directory. or -C .. ?
`man tar` look for the -C flag.  or are you asking something else?
yeh i have look at it. yes if it could change the path automatic backwords or other way around. as it know where it exacuted so
'automatic backwards'?
yes like tar /home/my/project/css .. <-- will tell it to actully pack /home/my/project/
how would tar know to do that?.  that's incredibly specific to your use-case, it sounds lke.  so write a wrapper script
well, it know where its executed right?. or does it never know what the current path is
you are askign to change the default bheavior of tar.  it makes no sense
what you get my point?
look at the many flags you can pass to tar and use one of those, or write a wrapper script if you have such a specific use case
no problem
first,  , check if you can find anything related at [URL] second. i hope your system has not crashed yet
no, as a normal user
but since you created the filesystem as root with sudo, your user doesn't have permission to it.  there's a mount option... i think it's 'user', or you can mount it, then chown youruser:youruser /path/to/mountpoint
See from what I gather there is supposed to be a default graphic driver.  that kicks in when the video fails
- Cards should go into 640x800 if theres no drivers anyway...
just try and see what happens.  thats the best I can suggest with these nvidia cards
Downloading some drivers.... Will they install anyway?
i go to localhost/phpmyadmin and get a 404
what happens when you go to http://localhost
Redirection. cat <<EOF > name_of_file <ENTER> line1 <ENTER> line2 <CTRL-d>
wouldn't really call that "edit", but ok... moving up a line, I don't think that can be done.
.bashrc most likely
when I do ps I see some ssh-agent which is launched as: ssh-agent /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /usr/bin/im-launch /usr/bin/startkde
sorry i dont understand what you mean with "yeah" you also cannot access it from tonline?
yeah
thanks
google and every site which uses google analytics is down
oo, thanks
did you know it's the first google result for "javascript directory tree" ?
hopefully Ubiquity will, too... someday
Hopefully.... It's 2 am here. I just realized
you mean #hardware?
No, ##hardware
what network is that on?
This one. freenode.
I was trying to copy things using basicley. its in digital ocean. I had 2TB of images there . (total 4tb) images were important. i checked fsck -N /dev/sda1
I don't know what basicley is and I'm not using digital ocean. What did fsck reply?
it says fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1. i wanted to pkill basicley it didnt work . so I restarted it. after restart everything is gone
try fsck -f /dev/sda1. !info basicley. This isn't an Ubuntu package, so it's not supported here. I don't know if anyone knows about it. Does fsck report any errors?. (fsck -f)
thx how do i ask lsof? i think i got it installed
you run the command lsof | grep 20128
sorry yes
whhats this gparted thing? can you go a bit more step by step or give me a guide to follow ?.  ?
gparted is a partitioning tool, it is there in the live CDs on Ubuntu and Linux, but can be downloaded an burned for separate boot up cd too
i can use that even if i used the "install on windows" thing ?
yes.  but you might have to fuzz a bit with grub
silverarow, and theres no other way with wubi? just want to make sure before i go out and find my usb or a cd haha
there might be, do you have a windows recovery cd? At least it can erase and reformate with ntfs file system
well i mean ive been able to uninstall it using wubi but for some reason every time i reinstall the same problem comes back (it gets stuck in boot up once in awhile, then when i install the driver for my graphics card it says i can no longer use unity)
oke  , can u help me with it ?
I don't know. ask and I'll try
For what?
that's your localhost, a lot of apps need it.
so what's the 'correct' way off adding dvd/mp3-support to Ubuntu?
*shrug*. isn't gstreamer-mad in universe?
sence when.  to trigger the gui its -d
you forgot the -manager part
:-(.  duno abought you but everytime i tryed a full dist update it left my system im a smoking pile of runes
well if you specify the issues next time perhaps we can work them out
Toma: I found a instruction set that was pretty good
link?
what troubles me is that I don't even get a chance to config the wireless interface..  what troubles me is that I don't even get a chance to config the wireless interface.
chances are your wireless interface is not supported. A lot of wireless chips arent. You might need to install a driver for it. Try searching the forums and/or google for your specific wireless card
same as apt-get -d install ?
Yes, -d is short for --download-only, but if I say "-d" then they'll say "what does -d stand for?"
I did man it, but the output was unclear saying it needs.  the output still says it needs etc amount of space after installation, so I wanted to make sure
It assumes that you will manually install, so it will still tell you how much space it takes when you manually install.
yes
and did you specify the static ip in ubuntu &?
ubuntu one>blogs.
it does not look like it. Just storage. I hardly doubt they allow you to make your own html or php pages.
i did. and it still wont boot. vgcfgrestore --file backup-fil vol
LVM or RAID?
lvm
Sorry, no knowledge of the problems LVM causes.
"why I setup ssh keys no no passwords were needed" <- i don't understand. you mean you create passwordless ssh keys?
I setup ssh keys SO no passwords were needed
but you probably still have a password given to the key
oh no I created the ssh keys without a text password that why none needed.  [URL]
i'd prefer to have keys protected by password.. but the same time i'd like to have them already unlocked when i'm logged in
your account is already protected with password. if you want 2 or 10 levels of passwords that's up to you and here you are now asking not to have them
i know how to create passwordless keys.. but that is not the point.  i'm asking something that seems widely supported, according to google searches... it just doesn't work for me
seems the same thing if you login and you don't need a password, then encrypt your home directory for level 3 security
uhhh just defrag the hd
I do all the regular maintenance
upgrade to linux :P
7 seems better, but now they are forcing 8 on us
noooooooooooo
I would, but I have trouble making any buntu boot from cd on hps.  7 runs lighter at least, on systems a couple of years ol. 7 runs lighter than Ubuntu even
you should check out ubuntu 10.04 minimal.  it only install the base os and then you selectively install whatever you want from the command line, that's all I use
after I found lubuntu I have been pretty happy with it on most computers, but still have trouble booting the cd on HP pavilions
it won't boot at all?
trouble is the cd will not boot up to the regular menu, and ends up in a black screen message. I cannot get past it some how
I've had that happen to me before, it might work if you try a different version of ubuntu and then upgrade
I think there are new buntus launched next month even, I shall try them. I think it is hard ware support issues
I didnt know it was.. but im from the uk myself
"Isle of man" ,"Tax shelter" [URL]
<> makes sense
so what are you you guys going to add. that you need to incorporate in isle of man ?. oh yeah .. how do you fix this .. Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".. glx missing , but glx is loaded in XF86Config-4
i can use the application as my pannel is visible but any thing fails to open from places
You mean, from places menu?
yes
you're running ubuntu 9.10, right?
yes
open the terminal, then run nautilus
is "run nautilus" a command
no, just nautilus
nothing happen it just get stuck in next line
strange. How did it start? I mean, are you working on a fresh install, or has it been working some time ago?
i think some services relating to nautils got stop...  i install the OS 2 hours ago
2 hours, Was it working at first?
every thing was working fine before.  i just installed the java and loged out. for next login it seems to be in bad shape ..
and after logging in again it's all broken?
xactly.  very strange that i could access Application menu, system menu but not the places menu..
btw, did the automatic update application pop up?
i guess no actually i just re-logined not re booted
yeah, you said exactly this, re-login.
I have fc-cache -fv, but font in terminal did not change .
how're you expecting it to change?
running dnsmasq/nscd and over vpn, ssh port forward 127.0.0.1:xxxx locally and foxyproxy configured for socks5 for 127.0.0.1:xxxx, should resolve to the same ip either way, and the /etc/hosts on the ssh server is set to the same thing, so i know it's not that. i put a file on a website i'm working on so i'd know if i'm hitting the dev server. so far that file is 404
sounds more like sshd_conf. ?. allot of variables with that setup jeeze. lets fly around three islands, over a mountain, and through a tunnel and maybe we can see a smoke signal
do you know what driver patch i need for [URL] oops. sorry. Atheros Communications Inc. AR928X Wireless Network Adapter *. thats what i meant to put
atheros should work
just any one though?
did you get the madwifi drivers?
thats what is confusing me. they have like 20. no i didnt
get ath5k then. !info ath5k
thanks man..
ah, dpkg -l php*
it started with system
mounting local harddisks or iso?
i have no devices attached except the USB CD-ROM drive
some bios configs don't allow for booting from external devices
the BIOS lists numerous external USB boot options
hmm.  just make sure the boot priority has the external device first, otherwise it may very well be a hardware issue
gbit network plus increase the send / receive buffers for samba from 8192 to 40960
how do you adapt the buffers?
socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_RCVBUF=40960 SO_. SNDBUF=40960 <- put that in /etc/samba/[URL]nf
under general options?.  and where to put the socket options part
yes, that's under general options
also for the socket options?
This is super weird. Does anyone know what the hell is going on? My friend downloaded both 64-bit and 32-bit 7.10 .iso..... Everytime he boots with the cd's it asks him for a password and username with a counter
session crashing on startup?
Its just weird. He tries to run the live cd. But it goes onto the desktop and 3 seconds later screen goes blank and goes back to the log in screen. We have tried diff iso programs and different cd's and 32-bit / 64-bit. Stil does it
PrupZeY: both will do.  that means for some reason your session is crashing.  perhaps try safe graphics mode or alternate install CD (or other options in !install)
Failed to execute child process "/usr/bin/dpkg" (No such file or directory)
: i suggest you boot your system from a live disk and copy all the binaries. and then do debsums and apt-get --reinstall install until everything looks good. oh, between copying and fixing, you should change-root over to your installation, of course
thanks, I'll try to make a live usb disk in this state
do you have another machine/system available?
restarting udev didn't help. I also restarted the network which didn't help either
then I guess a reboot is needed
Are you using ubuntu 13.04?
Looks like I'm still on 12.04.
I can't do this. I only can download thru firewall.  I can't do this. I only can download thru firewall :( and any client does not work :(
ask your system administrator to open a port
<>, he promised me this many months :), what client can download thru firewall ?
Because the firewall was designed to block the very thing you are tying to do. Hmm
I understand, but under Windows I can do this...
What client do you use on windows? What port does it use?
utorrent. <>, utorrent
What port?. Try using the same in linux
I get the same error: .: 14: Can't open /etc/init.d/functions
pastebin the script

does /etc/init.d/functions exist?
See my last. no it does not
find out what should provide that :) (use apt-file)
Hmmm thats a problem, just saw some nice error messages about corruption including 'module' which doesnt look too good... worst bit is I dont know which xD

any idea why im lagging so much, i didn;t used to
, u use virtual box?? or any other virtual app??
Ok, sweet, I'll check that out, thanks.  how easy is it to use?
it's not really easy. i was looking for a graphical tool to configure it, but i forgot the name
Ah, poo. Is there a way to make a shortcut/link that just opens terminal and runs "avast"?
yes. right click the desktop and choose "create launcher". avast will only scan for windows viruses, though, since there are no know linux viruses :D
no. crontab -e
nano?
no standard editor
does it have options on the bottom like ^write ^exit, etc. ?
no its not a standard editor. crontab opens on its own some shitty editor
hit ctrl+z. then type jobs. what does it say?
as in IRC chat groups :P
yes, what program you using for IRC

working?.  i missed what ur problem even was :/
Gnome can't load my hosts, so my network and root terminal are giving me errors.
ah, make sure u "sudo" edit /etc/hosts ;).  let me know if u still have problems. Be sure to say my name so xchat bleeps at me :)

Like, official ubuntu support or something?
Don't expect the plug and play experience that you are used to. Linux does still take a bit of work now and then to get it to behave as you'd like
Dumle29, New user, fresh install, boots to terminal. After nomodeset didn't work, and it dropped to the terminal again, I'm out of ideas and everyone else is too.
what's the hardware?
Dumle29 Nvidia 740M, intel i7, 16GB ram, 1080p 17" display.
i7 doesnt' say much :)
Dumle29, I have no idea what more you'd want. It's a quad core? Haha.

rhythmbox
there are some formats that rhythmbox cant or wont change the details of. I can fully manipulate anything that is .ogg

when I dual booted I played with Songbird. It seems to have good community support and features. I got the children off itunes and onto Songbird and they like.
k thanks
do you also use windows?
ya i have dual boot, but i dont get on windows that much
If you check out Songbird, beware that you can't share the music library with both systems, you will need to maintain two libraries (one of the reasons I left).
ya i did play with that and songbird doesn't work with anything else. Do you know anything about amarok?
No. I have stopped searching for music programs as Rythymbox covers my personal needs. Have you read the forums?
for some reason my ubuntu has it as read-only and won't let me fix it >_<.  what's the command?
you can format it from gparted
it won't do it. i click it, it says its formatting, and it's still read-only. or is gparted and disk utility diff?
gparted and disk utility is different
okay, i'll look for gparted then
sudo apt-get install gparted
I usually use alt+f2 and then firefox
you must use firefox-3.5.  or shiretoko. nvm, just firefox-3.5 works
?
alt+f2 and then firefox-3.5
ahhh.. so it's a different browser?
it does not have firefox branding yet. but yes, you have both installed
no its the broekn package error. not wine. thats the second time i got that error. doesnt happen with just wine
" wine1.7-i386 (= 1:1.7.55-0ubuntu1) " Not an ubuntu package .
i mean if i plan a simplest job with at it's not executed. i've already tried as superuser - still nothing
You mean at the command to run another command at a certain time?
yep

i have been trying for about 4 hours to get a gba emulator.... i apt-getted visualboyadvance. cant find any examples of how to make that load roms, i know its command line but i dont NEED a gui. i tried gnomeboyadvance, VBA-Frontend, qtVBA, VBA-Express.... gnomeboy gives python parse errors, the others wont make and qtVBA is arsed
sorry no clue. did you try looking on their web site?
yes, no documentation ANYWHERE
visualboyadvance that is
anyone here us visualboyadvance from command line?.  nothing on any of em, including there.  perhaps you can help with general make errors then ^^ i paste them

how to install the codec?
get ubuntu-restricted-extras, then win32codecs from [URL], and finally vlc<---that will cover most everything you ever need to play codec-wise
I tried copying .Xauthority (from my home directory, no?), but this didn't seem to have any effect. Are you suggesting to mount my real /tmp over the chrooted /tmp with -o bind?
i usually bind /dev, /proc and /tmp when working with X from within a chroot
excuse me, im really sorry
having to 'cd Desktop' is rather trivial ..' cd D<tab> enter '
when i open the terminal. there i can change that i want to start terminal with a specific command. but cd /media/Zeugz/Basic/ is not the right command. which command is it then ?
cd /media/whatever is the proper command to change the directory.. You do realize that linux is Case senestive. what happens when you use that command?
case sensitive is that i do have to consider that Zeugz is not zeugz
Case Senesitivity is a big deal. :) ZOO is not the same as Zoo is not the same as zoo
first nothing, when i close and open terminal there is an error ( in german it is "Beim Erzeugen des Kindprozesses fur dieses Terminal ist ein Fehler aufgetreten"
i dont speak german so no idea what it says.. Linux IS case senestive.. and from reading the 'gnome-terminal --help' docs there ius an option to start a gnome terminal in a specifc directory.. like in this example..  gnome-terminal --working-directory=/media/Public320/.  you could make an icon that launches that command and poof.. instant terminal where you wanted it
my logon screen does not appear after i shutdown x
does it appear on boot?
invokes nothing
which is a good sign since it means no module with 'mouse' in the name is loaded. whereas once you "sudo modprobe psmouse" again, it should show up
how can i do that
telnet {ip} {port}
thank you. no luck. tryin <ip> ..... and no movement. should i be doing that locally. as in on the server
sounds like either firewall or bad smtp config
ohhh yep likely my ufw settings. forgot i installed that...
uncomplicated firewall is uncomplicated :)
haha yep. which ports should be open
depends what protocol you're using - 25 for SMTP, 587 for TLS, and another one that escapes me...
i think 587 is smtp. no?
465 was the other one [URL]
so if i want to just send mail. not receive. what would be the best choice
25 for smtp, 487 if you want secure login
487?
...er...587 sorry
Broadcom bcm4312 rev 01)
any reason not to use the drivers provided by Ubuntu?
I get 00%
Yup. we are unlucky.
so there's no way to troubleshoot this?
I haven't found any workable solutions on the forums. I'd search the bug reports to see if anything comes up. I hate to say it but I have a windows box that records just fine.

hmm, should be ok. How much RAM do you have?
2gb
that's plent. I thought you'd say 256Mb which would make your system use swap more and explain the noise
This problem came with LTS version, no problem with 11.04 (Natty) version. Weird?. and that noise comes from speakers
so where is the problem if it's not in 11.04?
10.42.2 LTS version
then why not just use Natty....  maybe the newer kernel makes things nicer for your hardwre
No idea, I use that then. What difference betheen natty and lts version. natty works with me? 1.6ghz, 2gb ram and no idea about video card
kernel version and some package versions
ubuntu.  ubuntu
ubuntu is an OS - not an application, please define html rendering in ubuntu
for example i have msg8
I have no idea what msg8 is
is an instant msg from yahoo
then you want to enable html rendering within msg8.  in which case it's an application, nothing to do with ubuntu
but if i have some internet page wich dont show mw everything?
such as ?
this is all depending on flash player?
I don't know, thats why I asked you waht pages
like 5mb each
do you get the same error when you try from the shell?
yes
might want to try booting a DSL or Knoppix disk "toram" and see if the problem is there too. If it isn't, then do a lsmod to get a modules list, and see if the modules for the drive and ide chipset are different.
Not likely it'll work?
Not likely someone here has done it. oh
Which worked the first time, but after I unplugged it once I plugged it in again it stopped working.
I may be wrong....  how many times did you reboot =P
So far once.
hehheh
I tried to redo the guide a few times but it didn't get me anywhere.. Here's something more general then.
sorry, I have no idea really =\
No i'm trying to transcode a video, connecting to my http://localhost:port - and then trying to record that streaming live video okay. when I click transcode and choosed mpeg2. and then raw. I click filename then finish, it starts recording but here it doesn't preview the picture, so I can't WATCH while recording, thats one issue, and #2 issue is that the record doesn't have sound.
I have found similar issues when transcoding, particularlywhen dealing with basic mpeg2...I found I had to try various audio transcodings as sometime video would be fine but no sound, or certain combinations then could not be played by other devices
what do I do then... is it possible to record via Mplayer? or anything else, cause VLC is not doing a great job
are you using the GUI or the command line ?
i'm in X. i just opened VLC. then trying to transcode by going to file > wizard, so yeah its a gui
I can show you some of the full transcode commands I use if that helps
I'd like to transcode the live stream + watching it in the same time, does your command do that?
no but since you are getting some joy i.e. video but no sound then it may give you some ideas
okay
alternatively, what is your setting for the acodec=
just go easy and run it for the first backup steps of live boot no install, to ensure that all your files are available...
oh of course. I'll make sure all data is properly backed up before jumping to far. At this point data recovery and back up is the main priority. Converting another windows system will just be icing on the cake if possible.
yeah, i convinced about 10 ppl to give it a shot so far with 8.04 still and i m updating all the systems as i visit my firends :)
Well this friend just uses the computer she doesn't understand OS's or anything more than wanting to view pictures and listen to music so this should be easy. Hell it's a windows 2000 system for goodness sakes. But I'm out it's late...
Bodsa: yes programming languages
they are not a requirement. You can still do packaging work without programming knowledge
ok
#ubuntu-motu for more info
thanks for the link
your welcome
yeah im using gnome. should i use kde?
then check out epiphany
I tried both I get the same thing
does the system you connect to have an x server running?
not sure
because that's what xdpyingo is for, to get details of the x server: [URL]  so if no x server is running, it wouldexplain why
ok. how would i restart it
you'd need to run: startx but if you are connected via SSH it will display on the client afaik
oh.  what would you suggest
did you install ubuntu server by any chance?
no
what is the output of: lsb_release -sc on the server side?
lucid
and what desktop environment are you using?. manolitos: ask and see
gnome
if you run: apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop is it installed?
yea.  what are you thinking?
for some reason the x server hasn't started but enough boot has completed to complete the network setup and start the SSH server
yea but I can do X11 forwarding
hmm, weird. I'd check on the local system somehow (smarthands request) to see what's going on
hi  sure one moment. so, right now I have the situation described on stack exchange
well. scratch that. it doesn't work as i thought. maybe lsof can tell if there's a process active in the mount point
where do I check that?
volume control
,/etc/init.d/networking
k let me see...  did u get it?
k :)
pihus: this is a known bug I believe but beryl support is in #ubuntu-effects
Haha okay
maybe you acn just disable it in the laptop BIOS
I have removed hal in Xserver not command mode! that's Y it caused sine problems, but now using recovery mode doesn't work
heh, why'd you remove hal?. i reccomend reinstalling it emmediately
mm... not really... using the same machine, same network.......... but windows xp, i can connect to the other end, and performance is very smooth
ashley_, for the complete command ;) apt-cache search flash | pastebinit.  you're using tsclient?
i've tried to lower the graphics..... even scale down the colour to 256... but still slow.  yeah.. and i've tried rdesktop too
do you experience this behaviour with all the machines you try to connect to?
yup
what's it's loadavg?
mm... not sure if that has any effect... but my load is 0.87, 0.53, 0.32
do you have ways to generating debug information?
mmmm nope... i dont know how to do that with tsclient
without debugging info is kind of hard to tell anything coherent
another funny thing is........... since rdesktop is slow.... i tried to use vnc....... i installed tightvnc on that remote machine............. and tried to connect to it........ it prompts for password, but immediately disconnect after that
really? what kind of fw are you using on your host and in your remote machine?
fw?. firewall?. no firewall
fw => firewall yes.  or maybe a bundled security product which includes one
You answered me earlier, but I went afk. Sorry about that. What should my subnet be? I'm not very sure with what i'm doing.
i BELIEVE it should be 10.1.0.0. could be wrong tho
you got the link?
you are from bangladesh?
yes. may i go to shop to buy the .deb files ??. lol
[URL]
i guess an ide
what programming language?
well im used to VB, but id like to start with some C i suppose or python
what is your goal? you have to do a project?
you mean a bug in Feisty?
IIRC the problem arise if you changed the default brightness.  yes
yes adb_monster
and what version
sry. 904
ok yeah there's a command to use those toaster popups.  need to remember what it was though. although dbus would do
ok. thnak you. There is bad link for it in the wiki
im trying to find it now
yes, I am. Nothing fancy though. Just the cube stuff.
maybe some clash or weirdness there, whats your logs say ?
oki
please message me in here, .  lshw -c video
how?
!NAFAIK. d'oh. Not As Far As I Know.  what are you trying to accomplish?
That's even worse :)
Then I might learn something today
like sudo su script.sh?
no, like su; ./script.sh
Brilliant, thank you :)
though, if you don't know those kind of things, I'm not sure you should be writing shell scripts that run as root. or need any root access
I'm making a install script to install my favourite applications from a fresh install in ubuntu :). so its just sudo apt-get install ssh etc
how are you going to ssh into another box?.  and don't tell me you've get certificates without passwords set up. got**
cannot set correct resolution, tried reconfigure xserver, did not help.  i have i965 video card, 1280x800 lcd screen and the highest resolution i get is 1024x768 - but i have modelines for 1280x800...
resolution is set in the restart gdm once.  oops i meant just restart gdm
tried that, no luck
ok so are your drivers installed.  did you check the screen resolution option in System->Preferences
mplayer can convert video?
yes
errr, global if possible.  What should I do
use the chmod command to change the permission os a file... if you want to make the file readable-writable-executable by the user give the command 'chmod 700 /path/of/the/file'
thanks, but i was trying to look into some cmd line that have the cool options the guis have :)
bittornado then
could you please make 2 screens of the fonts tab in appearance preferences - fonts tab itself and of the details tab.  like this - [URL]  i'd be really grateful to you for that
you mean, you want to know the default hinting and smoothing settings for ubuntu?
right )
it depends on the machine. i don't think subpixel smoothing is used if it knows that you're on a CRT. If you have an LCD screen definitely use subpixel smoothing. really if you have a sane linux the defaults will be find. fine*
no it was a clean install. to ubuntu 14.04, and the folders were working initially
very strange
yep :P
Is this problem in every folder'. ?
yes all folders look like empty files
How work with the Guest account?
okay the problem was i was using the Icons theme: Tango instead of Ubuntu-mono-dark
okkk
it's been there for a while already
oh, first time I noticed because it was logging in and out like mad.
and whenever I do that it will go and installl something will failure at end.  [URL] it's 12.04
and you're trying to set up apache today is it?
no php 5.6
but your paste shows it's trying to install the apache module for php5, which is having issues because it can't install apache main...
aha so I should I fix this first?
yep
but how :P
i slightly suspect the use of PPAs ruining your install - 12.04 is a bit antique to hold out on, too.
You can boot from live CD and restore the grub from the terminal
but how?
You have type in the terminal: grub.  one moment... I'll check for the right commands.  you need to type: sudo grub. then you type: root (hd0,0). when your ubuntu root partion is sda1 or hda1. if it is hda2 or sda2 you type: root (hd0,1). next step is typing: setup (hd0). now close grub by typing: quit
er I have sda and hda I want to have grub on hda
graphics card. nvidea drivers
I thought nividia made linux drivers
no its a dell p4 motherboard so relatively old
you might need to try the "alternate" cd for install.
that is the only thing i could think but the weird thing is that 8.04 live cd boots fine ... hmm
bad burn?
"The following packages have unmet dependencies.". a list of packages
so :) go met them :). meet*
then E:Unable to correct you may have held broken packages. I'm in a CLI only interface at the moment trying to install enlightenment from a ppa, I'm wondering what can cause something like that
sudo apt-get install -f
right, at the moment I ran through all of the commands to clean up, but none of the packages mentioned were installed
what are you trying to install?
enligthenment DE. the ppa for 20, I should also mention I just did a base-install
did you follow [URL] ?
yes, and I got that error, so I removed the ppa and cleaned up
what did install -f tell you?
ah crap. what does CTRL A do in the CLI. never tried to type it before, just did it out of habbit. now I can't move the cursor haha
just hit enter. and retype
kk, now. i'll readd the ppa
then do sudo apt-get update.  then do the install
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.. The following packages have unmet dependencies:
can you pastebin the entire error?
Daftykins, I can't get to nomodeset
how come?
when I press F6, there was an error message on the Acer loading screen. it was on for half a sec, said something like "Can't find ??//?/ fsck" or something
hmm, my instinct would be to remake the flash drive as it could be a bit iffy.
Daftykins: Which program should I use to create the flashdrive?
which OS?
64 bit Ubuntu 12.04
which OS do you use to create it from, i mean?
I have access to Ubuntu 12.04 and Win 7.
universal USB installer from [URL] should be good for Windows
and for ubuntu?
just the command line utility 'dd' used appropriately would work
Oh jeesh. I've had experience with DD. My dd-fu is lacking..  even for a UEFI scheme?
well the thing is you don't necessarily need to boot with UEFI support, you could boot as legacy. if you could take pictures of each page of your BIOS setup that could be handy
just gdesklets. ?
yes
ok, thanks
np
thanks evan
yep i get crashes with flash. flash 9 for linux seems a little flakey to me
I can't seem to find and dev files :(. err packages
usually it'll be the same as the packages with -dev added to the end of the package name.
I am using tab completion after gtk2 with nothing with a -dev
just add dev after
Sorry, my posts are pretty spaced out with all the traffic in here. I said that "service lightdm status" says that it is started and has a PID.. s/started/running
what about pgrep?
You want me to see if the process is running using pgrep?
yup
brb..  Okay, the problem is manifest right now.
yeah?
pgrep lightdm = 1238
ew
service lightdm status returns the same PID.
maybe it's starting earlier than its deps
This seems reasonable..  Although, surely there's a mechanism to prevent that from happening?
upstart, theoretically :p
you know...it may have to do with my monitor situation...
check out /var/log/lightdm
I often change the amount and which monitors I'm using...
mm, wouldn't be my first guess
I'm using a laptop. It seems that the problem only manifests itself when I'm docked (so the laptop monitor is not being used, and two external monitors are being used)..  Nothing interesting in lightdm.log but there are five others ^_^
ohhhh. like maybe it's trying to show the login screen on one that doesn't exist
perhaps.
I could believe that
how cute, "write 35 bytes to daemon" "Read 8 bytes from daemon" come on!
that sounds super useful
hey!. x-0.log:. "Fatal server error: no screens found (EE) Please consult The X.Org Foundation support .... it points me to /var/log/Xorg.0.log. no screens found :). genius. oh... "Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration". But it must be a boot-up-time problem because when I service lightdm restart, it works just fine.. brb, starting my window server....  yo
yoyo. that's practically what 'java' means
[URL] resure: The last post.. eek.... I don't know if mine hands will let me type malloc!
on page 2?
no.  sorry :( page 1 :)
that looks nice and hairy. or #ubuntu-ffotpic, as the case may be
will do. I have a feeling this is also related to somethnig that is happening to a few games that used to run perfectly fine..  all that is there. http://i.[URL]
did you do something with themes, icons or wrestool/icoutils?
nope..  and this only happens in my Downloads folder. Everything else appears to work fine.
never heard of that and dont know why its doing that
is aplay one of the smallest (in terms of hard drive space) players,  ?
i cant think of anything smaller. !info aplay
oh no
seems to be part of alsa stuffs
you mean that i gotta get alsa stuffs. meaning not small.
its a cli based player
but how big is alsa stuffs?
alsa is currently making your soundcard work.  so theres no additional install needed
so how do i get aplay?. oh. great
type it in terminal
ty.
aplay /path/to/file.wav.  and robert will very much be your fathers brother
robert? what r u talking about,  ??????
bob's you uncle :)
who's your mama? 8-)
i see you dont have that phrase where you are
yeah, i Don't.  aplay says " can't play non PCM encoded Wav files" 8-(
its like "ta-dar" or "and there you have it".  install vlc then, its pretty small but pretty good for the average user
like i know u can clear gnome w/ "rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .metacity.  but i want to get rid of settings and keep all the files and stuff
well the best way would to create a new user and copy all the files across as deleting all the files starting with . is dangerous
ok.  could i create a new user and copy the files in its home drive over onto mine, having it replace everything?
yep
thanks
then you can delete your old user

I used Totem MPlayer and rythmbox for audio and the first two for the DVD.  I used Totem MPlayer and rythmbox for audio and the first two for the DVD
open mplayer without playing anything
K
right click in video window and open preferences
Done
then click audio tab and see what is highlighted in the list

try changing it to alsa
it keeps flashing an error that i cant read. [AO_AlSA] Unable to find simple control 'PCM', 0 is the error
click on configure driver in audio window with alsa selected
Done
sorry let me try that again
i use gutsy 7.10 and i installed firefox3b5. but i cant open any java pages. or applications :S
have you installed sun java 6?
No clue on ndis with Hardy but in Gutsy I had it set up before. And also in Vista it works fine. It's a software problem with b43.
try using ndiswrapper
dont worry. i got hang of this
use sudo
runs on all platforms too. works well with multiple monitors too
nexuiz4.51. is not bad.. just been playing that
I have a lot of files there and looking at the file log.MY-MACHINE I don't see anything
look at the ip address also and the overall samba log and syslog
from a PC I can open and modify all documents of the share but I cannot from another
thats user or network share permissions then
but I don't have put any samba user, nor for the PC that works fine
the username you are connecting to the samba machine as must be "authorized" to use the share you want
I use the force user and force group options in the samba share.  and it works for a new pc
then look at the logs.  as I said it sounds like user or network share permissions
Did you add a repo, libpam-mount, shows which pam_mount is part of. I don't have an answer, not everyone knows every app, however many we can find and help with if we get the correct details and app names is all.
not to experienced with terminology here: I took from the Softwarecenter 'PAM module that can mount volumes for a user session-Libpam-mount', how can I link to a reference in the repository?'
Ok, sweet, I'll check that out, thanks.  how easy is it to use?
it's not really easy. i was looking for a graphical tool to configure it, but i forgot the name
Ah, didn't see that part
it's cool
gnome-terminal -x "insert path here" ?
didn't try that. let me see
or sh -c /path/here
didn't work
the gnome desktop, default install.  if that is what you meant
I was able to add a battery applet to the gnome-panel and configure it to display a % left

i know.... :\
on ubuntu :). ?. still no option in this space then eh?
[URL]
13.10
13.10 isn't supported. install 14.04 (lts) or 15.04. is it unity ?
how i can upgrade to 14.04
you need to download iso, backup your /home directory, fresh install.
can't i directly upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04
once upon a time  , not anymore.
can you give me any link
you get about 3 months after a release to upgrade it in-situ. [URL] <- . also [URL] to find start-menu etc <-
looks to me like regular cron log
the "cron login as root" should get logged in auth.log, wouldn't it?
nope ?
Dec 17 12:17:01 alkis CRON[29959]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0). This line needs to be in auth.log, as cron "logged in" to run things. But the output of cron of course isn't there
this line repeats every min or for every run of cron. mostly its in-consequential. its just filling up log
It's not a log of cron, but a log of pam
I needed to check ssh auth log
You're looking at the wrong place to disable it
hmm

kareeeser i have a problem with my webcam driver, it works but when i suspend the system stop working.  do you have any suggestion for me ^?
with webcams? Unfortunately not... I have no experience in that :(.  maybe someone else
tnx anyway it's a usb Peripehal
[URL]
it does, but its not very comfortable.  as i said, its more an organizer
hummmm... well it's free so it doesn't hurt to check it out
sudo apt-get install ccsm will work?
!ccsm
heh
its pretty good and does 1600x1200
hrm
if i had a job i would have already bought one
id like to go past 1600x1200 too.. sigh. every time i get a bigger monitor, i get used to the higher resolution and then want more
above 1600x1200 is expensive
blah
see apple 30" lcd for example ;)
yeah. screw that
or the 1920x1200 lcds for ~ $2000
1920x1200 could be okay. i could see 2 facing pages on a pdf
but you could buy two 1600x1200 lcds for cheaper than one 1920x1200
but then you have 2 lcds
and a lot more screen space :). two 1600x1200 is roughly 65% bigger than a more expensive single 1920x1200
i want 2024x1536. :)
why not just a 9MP display ;)
where can i get one?
ibm and viewsonic make them, probably other companies too
er i meant 2048x1536. thats 3MP. crap
IBM T221
my 19" crt will have to do for a couple more years :(
only around $8000
hrm. lemme check my wallet. hrm. all i have are receipts showing that i USED to have money
plus it requires a special video card since no desktop cards can drive anything near that big
same with the large apple display
yep, but the apple display is only about half the ibm resolution, heh ;). and ibm's is only ~ 20"
9MP in 20"?!
ah 22" 9.2MP
Yeah
mmm, let me see
I did, but when I put a volume in the drive it just changes back.
How are you mounting it?
I had to mount it at one time as root because some of the files on a disc were hidden, now I want to revert it back to my old settings.
does not tell me how you did it - what command?
it automatically mounts it as root r/o. because Im in the fuse group..  sudo chown --from root:root john:john /media/cdrom0 < is what I typed
Sounds like something in fuse needs to be reconfigured correctly. Sorry, I am stuck when it comes to fuse. Maybe someone else can help you
I m doint that in the gui. what is the command ? I randomly tried sudo edit [URL]nf
whicheditor do you use,  ?
i can browse, but im doing it like this, Places>connect to server and then i take windows share and so on, but its terrible slow..
so you want to be able to browse, not have to add, is that right?
if theres some faster way
places --> network
i cant browse mshome
what happens when you try?
http://pastebin.ubuntu-[URL]
it's a dash/bash/sh internal.
i dont get it, could u give me example?
[URL]
Thanks.  Trying to figure out if i am able too stripe my boot partition
stripe? what do you mean?
can you download the 1% ?. that is the easiest part. use a program that supports resuming. which on linux shouldn't be a problem.
like what
Intel something, it's an onboard
how are you going to connect the projector to the laptop?
normal VGA-cable
the blue big thing?
eh? What blue thing?
normal vga cable.. like a monitor?
no tabs
no ideas, sorry :(
i was on that site..i dont understand nothin` :d
- do i have permission to PM you?
is it a directory in itself instead (not a symlink)?
I have a directory there, .esd-1000
Dapper?
yes.  drwxrwxrwt 2 bagoor bagoor 72 2006-08-23 19:07 .esd-1000
any simpler solution?
it's as simple as it gets :)
X is not working properly, even xfix does not work. All i can see when i log in is a black desktop with avant running at the bottom.
that is a good one, I assume you never get to the login screen
no, i log in and then i get a black desktop..  i see the login alright, but not my desktop
and you are using the live cd?
no installed 8.04
give me a minute.  you need to disable the extra features of the desktop (i.e. cubes, effects, etc) but you will have to do it from the command line
thanks. I will investigate further then plan a feature request in launchpad..  found that: [URL]
It might be a good time too, as I believe they've all but completely rewritten gdm before lucid release
nop dont know how to at all
Are you using Firefox?
chromium.  chromium
I'm not sure where Chromium keeps its temp files but what I always do when I want a YouTube video is I watch it at [URL] in Firefox, and after it loads all the way, check your /tmp folder for it. IT should be there until you close Firefox. So watch it then just copy/paste of move it from the /tmp folder.  So try watching it in Firefox just this once? :)
yep
between breezy and hoary then ?
yep.  dun worry, this is only a testbed. my main box is still hoar'ing away.  I'd like to start bug-submitting any quirks in breezy
ah.. well.. im not familiar with howto do it in synaptic.. i always use the commandline :)
ok and this for every DIR ?.  to much work,
that shows every subdir
ok, thanx
also man du - --max-depth=2 etc...
i went back to 10.10 after an auto-update to 11.04 failed.... i have nearly everything restored, this xscreensaver issue is next on the list... it works except for some modules, hence the query for assistance here.
surely clean installing Natty would have been wiser? Or Oneiric?
I nothing do for make host trusted, what I must to do?
also, try to login using ssh -v, you'll probably see why it refuses to create display.  just comment out the line ForwardX11Trusted, leave it at default
And what does 'TP' stand for?
maybe Twisted Pair, i am not sure
irssi looks ok, but it's console-based (like bitchx), and I'd like something which has a server backend, and a GUI frontend (maybe something similar to xchat).
you can connect to irssi using whatever gui irc client you want
. it's sensing the card. I can even mount it. manually. it used to mount the card automatically
do you have the dev in /etc/fstab ?
yup. I do. should I not have it there?
you should comment it out.  if you are running gnome, run gnome-volume-properties to double check your settings after that
error: device /dev/hda1 is not removable. error: could not execute pmount.  ping?
I suppose you are making some simple mistake, if not, you may have to configure ivman yourself
stupid.  dumb ass syntax error in fstab. duh
okay
you know it's still NOT automounting. damn this
read dmesg to locate the error message, plugin, and dmesg|tail
I have it installed. don't know if I'm using it though
use 'gksudo synaptic' not sudo/su
I was just calling it from the menu
oh, heheh, ...
Googled until my brain popped. I just want to make a usb startup disk of a newer relese to put on my netbook
well if ya bailing out.... you can just enable all backports.... or you can do just the one package and its deps.
Oh, ok. Where do i do that?
[URL]  ill help if get stuck.  there are other ways to do usb startup disks
Hmmm probably going to need them, but tomorrow I guess. getting very late here and I thought this wouldn't have been such a battle.
Circus look into dd and writing iso's
I got usb-creator, but it just sits there forever and says "Starting up">
e.g. dd if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/<USB Drive>
I created them as "Linux raid autodetect" beforehand
oh ok, you let the installer do it :) I think the array is usable while it's doing recovery, it'll just be sluggish (plus not redundant yet)
so I can create the fs and fstab entry on it and start copying data?
yes, but remember, if a drive fails right now, your data is gone
I'm migrating data from an old server, so if a drive dies, I've still got it on the old server.
go for it then I'd say :)
is there a windows version?
No. But since it's a standard, there are plenty of windows clients, such as netmeeting.
who?
The maintainer of the git repo
and how can I know who is he?
[URL] is an pretty official repo... but in your case, I'd ask the one who suggested to run that command.
your ftp server has a cap on it, it sounds. you need to go into your settings and make sure all download/upload caps are removed. or set them rediculasly high
umm, how can i check, using proftpd and not seen any such cap in the conf file
umm, hold on. sudo apt-get install gproftpd
i think i get the same caps if i transfer files over http (lighttpd server)
then it will be in system>admin>gproftpd
can't do gproftpd as its a server os and no gui
ooh snap. umm. hrm
maybe if you can locate the line in the gproftpd conf file
sure, lemme look it up. lemme just pastebin this conf file
thanks :).  not sure if its a system wide thing as get max 4mb/s over http too (lighttpd server)
[URL] that's how mine's setup, and I get 100megs a second
from what i can see there is some ratelimiting (TransferRate RETR 1794 for example) i'll check more on this.  i have no such lines in my config
my config was built with gproftpd, and I set it to no cap
thanks for this, i'll play around with my config and see what happens
arg. there is a cap. lol. it's 2444 up and 1794 down
hehe, i thought there was
So for an entire folder the size is 47GB on one HDD and 96GB on the other..  ^
But are individual file sizes showing as different? That looks to me like different block sizes on the 2 file-systems, if individual file sizes are the saem
It's an INPROCOMM IPN2220
Intel 2200b/g?
what. is not there
That's where [URL]ck lives *IF* the mysql server is running.
can you elaborate?
not really. James_M: ok, lets try anotherone. James_M: w8
yeah i understood
:)
i want to build a dhcp server that s all. i use dhcp3-server?. but if i remember well i need another package no?
do you have 2 network cards in that computer ?
no just one
actually, that might not be critical, if it is only going to be DHCP server.
no problem. My motherboard has two. On Windows everything is fine. The motherboard automatically detects which input I use.
hmmm. I dunno then man.. sry
thx anyway
no problem. k guys - apparently when you swap screen resolutions in vmware it goes buggy and the scanlines get messed - is there a config I can alter via a term session then just reboot?
im on the website documentation is small
I'm not pointing you to the web page, I'm pointing you to a man page and explicitly telling you it is informative.  I assume you're familiar with normal cron?
yes i a little..im just so frustrated right now..i have worked on this for 4 days straight..
ok well take 5 more minutes to read and then it will be less frustrating :P Do a simple thing first like one of the examples
I have ~/bin directory, I want to point ~/bin to a directory in my system , on 'll' command it should look like " bin -> /home/ubuntu/workspace/Scripts"
you might be looking for symbolic links? ln -s ?
yes but bin directory should point to /Scripts directory
ln -s /home/ubuntu/workspace/Scripts bin #?
doesnt work. :
maybe it's the other way around then
rm -r
sorry.. rm -r
<rdw2001..> is that a windows utility?
no, it's usually either a floppy (for old computers) or a very small .iso.  it is the only software out there that can definitively tell you if your HDD is borked.  it *seems* that you have a hardware problem....  have you tried switching USB cases, first?
<rdw2001..> I think my USB, just the one, is gonged. All others are alright though
b/c something that *can* happen is this: there may not be enough USB power to spin the drive... some usb ports put out more power than others.  the inability for linux to see the drive (as a /dev/sd* ) can be something as simple as insufficient power or a bad usb case.  the best way to know for sure is plugging the drive directly to the Motherboard
i think u've a point with the power issue, although all others have been alright this particular one is a problem
the problem is most prominent on laptops.  also, i find it useful when i have a lot of USB devices to use a POWERED USB hub..  my macbook (regardless of whether or not i use OSX or ubuntu) is notorious for USB power problems
no.  i am on tsclient 0.150
i`m sorry but i can`t help you-i just have similar problem
i thought alsa didnt need a multiplexer
i'm using woody and kde. if i get a message on giam while i', listening to a cd, i don't hear the bell in gaim.  but when i turn off the music, all of the gaim sounds come in. delayed.
well im not hearing any sound right now. not giam not rb
sorry but my experience was with kde/arts and not gnome/esd. have you tried the site? it has a link for sound.
thansk
first things first, you need to have alsa detect ur sound card
alsa detects my sound card i thing. think. it lists my card in the volume control app
make sure that alsa sound server is not muted. i don't know if its on by default in wart but its muted when you compile it
i checked it doesnt seem muted
hmmnn...
you said there was something about sound on their site?
yes..let me look.  heh..sorry but it was 'sounder'. not sound
lol. let me check to make sure the plug didnt pop out of the back of the computer
yep, its stuff like that half of the time :)
apparently thats what happened
cool..enjoy
whoops i guess not. :((
i wonder if anyone has gotten sound up?
sound works when i plugged it into the onboard sound card just not my sb live
maybe there's something about it in the mailing lists..
apparently everything is using oss. and i cant have that
not alsa then?
i know, these are 2 desktop managers. I've to choose between gdm and lightdm and i want to choose the lightest.
what version of Ubuntu?
the whole /boot is gone.
are you booted into the system? do you know how /boot disappeared?
i am. yes. it died when sudo rm -rf /boot was typed in....
i see, well don't reboot
actually, i'm dumb. sorry, that command was done. if i list my / i do not see /boot right beside /bin (if you know what i mean). can i steal /boot of my live usbkey?. *off my usb key
you kind of need to regenerate it, which i think is possible.  what does the output of this command give you uname -a
usually use what package to download?
!ppp.  You can use a web browser to download things.. You need tobe more speific.
like i want to download a movie from a bt website ?
theres dozens of torrent clients out there.. !torrent.  transmission is the default client
i will try
I have to wonder whats to try. :) you click on a .torrent link.. and it should pop up transmission and start downloading.... !info unison
thanks  - you reckon it's safe to assume it doesn't affect OS X either ? Apparently it works via javascript rather than activex, so that made me a bit wary...
I believe its just a windows virus.
I have a pci hardware conflict issue.  cannot use PCI FX5200 which is colliding with other devices on the PCI table ( tried changing irq in bios ) , all choices , there are no other changes I can make as far as I know but I may be wrong
Try #hardware, they are usually very useful
MTR?
TR. MTR*. It's available in the Ubuntu package repos. If you want a version without X11 requirements, use "mtr-tiny". If you want a GUI: "mtr"
yeah
<> did u do the bonding first
yeah.  it used to work before the upgrade to hardy
<> what did u do after that
send file from phone to pc, doesn't send
<> check ur phone settings
they're correct
<> r u able to send files to ur pc frm ur fone
no, that's the problem
<> but u said ur unable to send files frm phone to pc..
yeah, and you just asked if I can send files from phone to pc. <> <> r u able to send files to ur pc frm ur fone
<> try sending files frm pc to phone. <> try doing the other way
so ubuntu-10.10-netbook-[URL]o is the right thing, though?
yes, it just defaults to the gnome desktop if your system doesn't support it out of the box, which some older or proprietary cards won't.  under Admin > Hardware Drivers you should run a check and see if there is a driver available, this will greatly enhance video performance and enable Unity after installing.
they are installed.
thy with vlc then
yes, the problem is, the driver hasn't been in the kernel for long..
hmmm,..... bugger
none yet ... it the board that a local computer shop is using and I'm trying to find out if there are any issues ... I have found no cons searching it on google ....  so, I thought I'd ask here ...
find out what chips it uses, then find guides and the like based on that
.. well i've tried following the README but to no avail...
where does it fail?
it says
(don't flood)
"copy the ungzipped file to /usr/src/linux-2.6.x and run "#patch -bf -pl < patch-atmel_reset". this is a requirement i'm pretty sure because it says in order to make the driver work for 2.6 kernels i'd need tod o that
are you positive that the included kernel with Breezy doesn't support your hardware?
so i tried that and then i get this - no file to patch
what device is it?
but it does not ...
delete anything after a = and a space, including the equals and space
i made it executable and clicked it and says veryfing integrity then uncompressing installer. then return to exit
use teh command line.. not double clicking.. look for error messages
is there some reason why I can't get it to work in firefox (as in launch)
ohh. you want it in browser ?
yeah, like mplayer-plugin
oh.. then i dunno... mozilla-xine works fine for me
is that a plugin?
yes.
I just searched synaptic but it didn't come up
google it - there is a plugin.
xine is installed, and firefox is installed. ahhh
http://cambuca.ldhs.cetuc.puc-[URL]  i am sorry they are RPMs.  perhaps use alien ?
well exactly, it does work in ubuntu and it certainly doesn't in fedora :)
I know that ubuntu does do "some" prelinking, but not everything is prelinked. like if you install new things...none of those are prelinked. unless you do it yourself
Pain in the rear
*luck
Exchange support is total nonsense
hah, yeah. that goes in windows ;P. osx still hasnt nailed it. though 10.6 will be addressing it significantly
i cant seem to find my integrated webcam when i use lsusb or lspci I'm not sure where to go from there
I would run ' tail -f /var/log/syslog ' in terminal and see if the system picks up when the cam is connected .
bashing-om: nothing happened just have the >
xtl+c to close that terminal . and open a new terminal ( ctl+alt+t - unity ) . and in this terminal type ' tail -f /var/log/syslog ' . And nothing else . In this terminal is the tail of the log and the (-f) is to see all that gets added to the log file . Terminate the logging in that terminal with ctl+c . to return to CLI prompt .
kind of. I have some scripts that needs to be run on each desktop so they register to our LDAP/Kerberos environment. Which means, right now my only solution is to run around to 50 desktops and run a bunch of scripts on each =(
it's kind of a bummer to see that on linux. you don't have remote management solution?
yes. Landscape =D
i mean, like ssh with keys?
but they are safe right?. MuhammadAG the updates are safe?
yeah
that doesn't show how to change the theme
it does. look harder
and its login screen, not login window as it used to be till jaunty
?.  go to local in that and chagne theme
i don't see any "login window" in my karmic's system > admin, i see "login screen" and it doesn't allow me to change theme, it just allows me to enable/disable automatic login and change timeout
aah sorry karmic yeah its not possible.  damn.  because the gdm is separate now :(.  dont know this one
i dont get it
gnome 3 doesnt use compiz
Huh?. i get this purple screen with 4 things
what are the 4 things
Ubuntu. Ubuntu options. windows 8 something. and something in brackets
and when you choose windows 8?
I am trying, I am try to figure a way to reinstall GRUB and yes I have live cd
One of the options on the liveCD when you boot it up should be to install GRUB Loader, I used it when windows re-wrote my MDR directory on the HDD
must be a chrome issue i would never install chrome
FF does not work either...
works here
well.. Oh well lol. Me too, however, neither FF nor chrome work now.
i had to start it manually...how can i make sure?
on the last 100+ ubuntu installs ive done - its alwas added itself to startup as a service.. check your sysv configs//etc/init.d and /etc/rc.## links i guess.. or one of the sysv config tools
modify grub? in what way?
change the default boot partition..
can I read about modfying grub from the shell?
man grub maybe. but its complicated...
of what?
[URL]st
what do u mean a world of pain?
Just that: a world of pain
ubuntu bit like windows keep changing stuff lol
oh my yes. It can be frustrating.. the whole init / upstart thing would be painful to an RHEL type
basically Im a red hat based server admin and Ive been asked to look at an ubuntu server thats borked but theres a few differences in locations service names stuff like that
LTS is for production. The regular distro is actually pretty bleeding edge.  what's the prob. exactly?
hmm i'm not sure. i'll try some other jacks though.  can you change hte port with pactl too?. ah it's pacmd
your configuration is for alsa not pulse audio right?
i dunno it's the default. i don't use gnome, if that's relevant. i tried pacmd set-sink port for both available ports, but i didn't get sound on either. I did get a click in the headphones as i switched though, so something's plumbed in
the configuration you linked is for Alsa. You can control it with alsa-mixer. Pulseaudio is different software.  which ubuntu/Linux flavour are you using?
yakkety.  i put it in one of the ports at the back and it worked...
yay
no real issue running as eth1..  just curious why
module alias perhaps?
when it was running normally before I re-installed
look in /etc at all the files relating to modules, modprobe etc
theres a FAT option, but it does say (32-bit version). is that the same as FAT32?
what are you formatting with?
used ubuntu's built in stock disk utility. gui. i.e. System > Administration > Disk Utility
ah. interesting way of saying it, but i presume that yes, that is the same as FAT32
LightDM??
if so edit /etc/lightdm/[URL]nf
I dont think I am using LightDM
are you using Gdm
i'm back from tv....
what were ya watching?
I can't find it in there. What is it?. Also, where can I customize my Keyboard Shortcuts, binding keys to my own commands? Do I have to use xbindkeys or is there a GUI for it in GNOME?
Notification Area
Oooh. That's the least intuitive thing ever
Menu > System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
haha, yeah probably... sorry
its a very interesting topic. - What is this "critical" data anyway?
so id like to copy the cd to my hd under terminal and then run install from the hardrive
Have you tried an ubuntu livecd?
yeah, 127.0.0.1
are you running DNS on this box?
no!
are you still able to get names resolved?. do you use DHCP or static IP
yes, but I would like to know what nameservers I am using. dhcp
yes to... ?
i say we find those bastards. and make them pay. how dare they ship out such software with no readme
lol.  well.... is is free
no its not. it cost me time. time i can never get back
lol
no,
did you check the fujixerox site?
but i searched in forum. no find cp105b solve post. fujixerox web, i looked. not driver, only fireware.
check turboprint and [URL]
7.04 hates the ATI X1000 series and doesn't load X. the text install from the alternate disk stops functioning after it detects hardware
try 6.06
what's even weired is that I previously had gutsy installed earlier this morning, in fact, this is my 2nd install of the day as I managed to blow up X on the first one with fglrx and compiz. *weirder
try xubuntu kubuntu its not long till gutsy is stable.  if all else failes run live cd for awhile
i need it e.g. for my netbanking
but why don't you install the system and then try again?
i am experimenting with the persitent feature and i want java.  why not?
ok well, are you running the 32 bit or 64 bit version?.  I just would prefer the installed version since it's so much faster and the stuff you do to it last after rebooting :P
I know, I know... but I am looking for a GUI frontend
You could always wine + sqlyog
Wine seems not to work as expected when virtualizing, like I am right now
alternatively many might recommend using apache + phpmyadmin though that's not the preferable solution.....
oh it shows. thanks.  but it does not show for how long that user has been logged
it shows when they logged in, guess you have todo the math yourself
i told u theres no method to do that!
yeah, so more than likely it's going to be a bit more complicated :) you may have to play w/ the stream, or whatever php's equivalent is

no
I tried both dvi and vga and it doesnt work
thats very weird.. ive always had 100% success with my various dvi monitors.
the screen isnt even detected so I cant even see what's happening
Hmm.. you dont have 2 monitors attatched do you? or a monitor + tv out?.  what video card anyway?
geforce 7600. I had a geforce 8600 before. It didnt work on both.  and no I only have one screen
im out of ideas then.. Unless you need to move the thing to the other video output on the cards.. but i imagine you tried that...  if the thing has a tv out.. id be curious if that worked..
Thanks for your answer, so far there's no way to counter this right?
it's not exactly a problem though.  what you're talking about is not the purpose of most cron daemons
unrar (from [URL]) needs it... version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by unrar)
tried looking in synaptic, it ahs a handy search function ;)
I have. and  this is a server, SSH access only. I installed g++ which got libc6-dev and libc-dev. but it's still erroring
libc!=glibc. i'd try looking for it with sudo apt-cache search glibc|grep glibc. add a -i to that grep
its there in my gutsy... its also in the Feisty faqs etc : (
not on gnome it isnt...
I'd take a screen shot... but please just trust me it is : )
i trust you it just isnt on my menus never has been.  it is on my kde menu though under system settings
[URL]  just a google image search, not mine
its probably because I dont use gdm i use kdm

gksudo nautilus is dangerous and unforgiving if you make a mistake, but will give you the permissions needed
does it reset after a while ?
close down nautilus and back to normal
I get that error from update manager. I get it from apt-get upgrade. And I also get it after downloading the stupid .deb from the ubuntu repos and doing dpkg -i util-linux
tr sudo apt-get -f install
same thing.
are you using hardy?
yeah
id remove the deb you manually installed anand try get it from repos
when i put the disk in. it starts to load and bam
what disk and where? more details please
im sorry. i downloaded the ISO from the Ubuntu website. and i burned it to a disk. i used powerISO. as to where... im not sure how to answer that.. i apologize for my incompetence. correct. the laptop currently has no OS
may i ask you its hardware specs?
The following packages have unmet dependencies:. kubuntu-desktop: Depends: konversation but it is not going to be installed. .. it says that when i use apt-get
[URL] read the part about adding extra repositories you probably have to do that
okay. i'm jsut having some weird problem - thought that might fix it. dunno what drivers im using.
what's the problem?
i've been posting it periodically since it gets flooded out.. one sec. Balz, When i scroll a whole bunch with the scroll button on my mouse or the arrow keys, after a while if i let up on the scroller, it will still continue scrolling for a bit. Does this for most apps, but it's particularly bad in firefox&epiphany. Anyone know what this is or where it could be coming from?
that's a hardware insufficiency. your computer is too slow
oh noes!! what do i need to upgrade? ram? video? CPU?
i used to get that A LOT when i was running ubuntu on an old toshiba satellite. It happened a lot with firefox.  it depends on what your hardware specs are. What are you running as far as OS and hardware?
Hardy(8.04 not sure if that matters), 512MB of RAM, Intel onboard chipset(82845G, Brookdale-G), Pentium 4 2.3GHz Processor...
that sounds pretty decent... are you running compiz and compiz effects?.  what you can try is right clicking on the desktop, going to change wallpaper, then selecting the tab with desktop effects and selecting "none"
Not sure. I never specifically enabled anything, but i see it in the process list i think..
by default you may have compiz effects enabled. See my previous message
alright..  that fixed it! thanks very much!
the fact that you have onboard graphics could contribute to the slowdown since compiz uses some more significant graphical power
if i upgrade my RAM from 512 to, say, 2GB, would i be able to enable compiz once again?
Strategy: np. You have plenty of ram for a non-gaming desktop. if you want to run the desktop effects then you should get a graphics card.. Strategy: or you can run xubuntu
Okay.
are you using a desktop or a laptop?
custom-built desktop i built a LOOONG time ago.  lemme think. i was about 10 so.... hmmmmmmmmmmm maybe nearly 3 years ago?
then popping in a graphics card shoudl work beautifully. newegg it up
envy is on the sinaptic repository..yes you must install the accelerated drivers for it.  envy is on the sinaptic repository..yes you must install the accelerated drivers for it

where did you get the file?
to program guis?
Yes. gtk is what Gnome uses; qt is what KDE uses.
alright, i'll try it. thanks
There are of course many others too.
be my guest and rattle them off. lol
You may want to try 'anjuta' on KDE or um.. I forget its name... on Gnome..  Nah, google would be far better at doing that.. open or "open" ?
So I guess I need a mac, considering there are not any that allow for full customization in windows
Mac's are the only real option for Multimedia/Authoring at the moment
thx, I simply need to install some missing packages, do you sugegst to do it from the CD?
The proper repo URL for Intrepid would be "deb http://old-[URL] intrepid main" and such ones
marcn: eht0: negotiated 100basetx-fd flow-control, link ok
so the kernel sees the NIC and thinks it is okay. has a link (ie cable is plugged in)
yep. lights on and everything. when i use the network menu to select the ethernet, it tries to sign on and get an address, then stops. marcn: correct
sing on? to what?
sign on. marcn: to get a dhcp lease
ok, there is no authentication going on. DHCP is just a broadcast request
marcn: ok
try: sudo ifup eth0
marcn: done that. marcn: it comes up. marcn: says it gets dhcp
any message?
marcn: then still nothing. marcn: ifup messages are completely normal. says it gets an ip
take a look at /var/log/daemon.log what does the dhclinet say?
marcn: no msgs about eth-. marcn: only about wlan, which is all old. marcn: nothing in the log cept stuff from yesterday
in one window do sudo tail -f /var/log/daemon.log and in another sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
marcn: doing it. marcn: what am i looking for in this tail now?. marcn: says some stuff about avahi not being configured i think
should see lines about dhclinent -- bound to, DHCPACK, DHCPREQUEST.  using network manager?
marcn: a little yeah. marcn: it looks like tail shows it getting dhcp. marcn: and avahi is disabling itself
avahi is some adhoc network naming, not a problem.
marcn: figured. marcn: well it says its getting a dhcp lease. marcn: but nothing goes through
What is your DHCP server? a linksys router or such?
marcn: yes
and that IP is not showing up on eht0?
marcn: but this hasn't worked on any router
what kind ow hw?
asus eee 1005ha. netbook marcn
strange. try turning off the wifi from network manager. by default network manager should switch to the writed connection if it sees both wifi and wired. assumption is it is faster
marcn: nope, just uses wifi. marcn: it's been like this for a while. wireless is fine, wired lights, but won't send any [packets or recieve them. marcn: is there some reason dns wouldn't work for wired but only for wireless/
does it support PXE? maybe try booting and ask for PXE/network boot. if you get an IP you knwo the hw is working.
marcn: good idea
that is why they pay me the big bucks ;-)
ok. lets say i have now a partition ready. how do i move it to be at least side by side with my home partition?
1. reduce windows partition. 2. increase home partition.  it have graphical interface, you get what you see
how do i do that?
do you see a menu when you start ubuntu?
yes
you choose the first kernel, the first option, right?
well... i just choose the SO, kernel does everything automatic here
the second kernel says: (recovery mode) do you speak portuguese? it might say : recuperacao or something
I read all that - did all that. On Xine it plays sound fine, but the picture is garbled.. On Mplayer - it's all blank - you can forward the image but it won't play. On Ogle - it's even worse than xine - totally garbled video
have you enabled dma?.  you get choppy or no picture?
DMA on my player? I think it's on. Same player and disk worked 100% in Fedora 1. Snowblink: On Xine I get 50% picture - like it's all fuzzy and chooped with rectangles. Snowblink: On mplayer it just won't play - I can forward, but it won't play.
xine-check, hdparm, video drivers - those are the things I'd check
what about my video drivers? I have tried xv and xvshm and GL - they all do the same: nothing!.  I am running nvidia driver fine. all other apps work fine.
is it okay when you look at mpegs or avis?
yes.  Could it be something in my XFree86 config file?
hdparm /dev/<yourdvddrive>
HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument. IO_support = 1 (32-bit). unmaskirq = 1 (on). using_dma = 1 (on). keepsettings = 0 (off). readonly = 0 (off). readahead = 256 (on). HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument. (sorry don't know if that was rude!)
yes - you should use pastebin
sorry - ouch.
that looks okay
I'm using x-chat - can't find a "pastebin" anywhere..  This drive worked under Fedora Core - so I thought it would be fine
are you running warty or hoary?
snow: the first one - warty I think
[URL]
I have installed KDE and am using that. Could that have stuffed something?
Ah. Have you tried under GNOME?
Actually yes. I opened a second X server on ctrl-alt-f8 and tried there. no go
What's the load on your system when you try to watch DVDs?
brb. +1 20%. about 20%. xine = 20 to 30%.  so the load is not bad.
I would guess at your driver, but I use ATI I'm afraid
hmmm. I had same card (maybe same driver?) on Fedora - all worked fine!. snowblnik: Thanks for trying to help me! I will try mplayer forum.
try again here later - it's early yet
well, I'm not there yet.. I need to get started troubleshooting this but I'm not good at ALSA stuff.
"ubuntu-bug" ut I can try to help you out too
what's "ubuntu-bug"
in the console type aplay -l.  type it in console
I need to do this from the command line.
Why, is the machine remote?
which part are you questioning? :)
you have to use modules which fits to your xen-kernel which is amd64 and you are using i386
oh.  thanks
easy enough :)
on my desktop i think i have gnome-keyring or something, i can't remember what i installed but i have to type the passphrase only ONCE every time i login
It depends what passphrase you mean then. If it's public_key pass then you must enter that each time it's used. If it's just your git access password, then setup a keypair on the server and upload the public key to the git server
it's the publickey pass
then it is how it should be. Unles you install gnome-keyring or similar on the server I guess
that's what i'm asking, i'm not sure what package it is
pam_gnome_keyring may have something to offer you. That's a starting point only though. I can't help any more http://is.gd/JKt7gd
thanks for ur help

so is there anything I can do to get it working right?
[URL]/  you can add ideas you have about improving ubuntu here.  you can check the bugs at launchpad and see what ubuntuforums has to say but it is a case by case thing if it works or not--never been able to get it working myself
thanks bhazang. *
sorry not to be more helpful
I cant find alsatools.. or with "-". .. but when I searched for alsaconf.. I got up: Note, selecting alsa-utils instead of alsaconf.  guys in #debian says alsaconf is missing..and wondring where it was gone:p.  *where it went*
alsaconf is needed to detect your soundcard and set it up
exactly.. but seems like its impossible to get hold of
probably its in the package alsatools
it dosnt exist any package named that
that IS new to me :s.  try alsa-base
E: Couldn't find package alsatools.  got that installed already... but as I said.. apt-get resolved alsaconf to alsa-utils.. but got that one installed as well
to install. and see if that has it
so.. seems like apt-get belives alsaconf is inside the alsa-utils package.. but it isnt
a sec
ok, and let's say I'd like to use ALSA, is it possible?
you can probably install any missing packages.  are you using the admin account?
: I'm using the account which was initially created during install
ok. just removing being in the wrong group as a reason not to work ;)
I think I need ALSA because I'd like to test a java application, and it looks like audio playback with java under linux requires ALSA
try with esd, if it doesnt work get the gstreamer plugins and switch to alsa
ESD sound works with music player, but not with the java app. sound is ok ... I'd just like to make sure ALSA works
ok. I'm not realy good with sound. jump into synaptic and make sure you have what you need, and work from there. also check [URL] and [URL]
yes, but not by me.  i found it through a search
I gather that any regression like that is treated as a priority bug
throwing a party and don't want to let anyone use anything but the music player (they love to sabotage)
I have two suggestions: 1) just use the guest session (when you logout all changes are lost) or 2) read the admin guide about locking down gnome (there are 2 documents, read them both) at [URL]
about the guest session, exactly all changes? like browser bookmarks, filesystem, application settings etc
yeah, everythingg
8 second lag!!!
[URL]  ^
my little computer's struggling
might take a while aye
yeah.. i'm struggling to get past the welcome screen of the installer.. what does the OEM install option do? just wipe the hard drive and install?
um?
yes.  no lsmod doesn't give anything. but lsusb gives
What about '/etc/init.d/bluetooth status'?.  Ok run 'sudo modprobe bluetooth' and pastebin if there is any error message
i did modprobe bluetooth..it dint produce any error. but there was no output too
Now check the output of 'lsmod|grep bluetooth' again. It should show the module is loaded.  No output typically means success
yes it came
Now do 'sudo service bluetooth start'
done service bluetooth start
And now restart sys>prefs>bluetooth and see what it says
bluetooth is disabled :(
What does '/etc/init.d/bluetooth status' say?
hm hope that 3d acceleration will work better on 9.04 than on 8.10
what part to you mean  ?. DRI enabled by default and such ?
well inteldrivers suck. got the 965chipset
m yeah
dri enabled
intel isn't that open source if I'm not mistaken
dri enabled and glxgears gives me 70fps
anyway, running 9.04 here and it runs likea charm. 70 fps +. my god :p. gonna check how much it's here
fusion works like charm but when it comes to rotating it its gets under 25fps and wine works likes crap
21333 fps here. yeah, wine runs super here too
yes
ok, how are you sure the jobs aren't being run?
i set a simple one in /etc/crontab * * * * * root /bin/touch /root/test.test and no luck
have you checked your mail (or root's mail) for any errors -- and btw, touch should be /usr/bin/touch
this is a new server and I have not installed any "mail" capabilities yet
every system has a mail reader to read local mail - it should be at /usr/bin/mail
your statement is not entirely accurate
regardless, have you checked your mail????
There are no errors not even in the log files
errors are sent via mail ...
I want to do anything I can to ease the installation seeing as that it only goes as far as grub install now, and gets stuck there. So I thought perhaps clearing the mbr before installing might help.
I am not sure if it does any sense, however if you are familiar with dd you can directly overwrite your MBR with anything. However, this can be really dangerous (if you make a mistake, your full hard drive can become unreadable)
ed - I installed the Adobe package and that helped a bit - now it loads for a few seconds then clocks out again.. I am running 9.04 on my Macbook. VMware is a wonderful thing!
I think that you have to purge all of your flash packages except for one (the one you intend to use)
ed - that's seems to be the consensus from everything I have found on the forums. But I don't have any other flash related programs installed. Perhaps an uninstall and a reinstall?
I don't really know what the problem is either. I guess reinstalling is a good a choice as anything else. I am running firefox 3.0 and the adobe-flash (proprietary) and it works (does not lock) but when I had a poor network connection it used to lock (like below 512KB/s down)

thanks!
or sr1.  you have two cd/dvd drives?
yes
they are sr0 and sr1. your hard disks are sda and sdb.
why does ubuntu use scsi emulation?
it is not scsi emulation, it's just the new pata_* drivers in kernel 2.6.
php5. I'm so used to BSD I tend to get lost sometimes with the ubuntu packages & such..
extension for use with what?
extensions to use with php5. I want to install a bunch of extensions, but I don't want to install them all manually. I would prefer to install them from a config selection list or something and install that way.
what extensions.  php is an application/scripting lanaugage
should I forward anything beside port 20-21 ?
tcp port 21 is all that is needed, unless you changed what port number it listens on. tcp/udp 20 is for something else (i forget what)
hoary, breezy or dapper?. :)
breezy, .
it's listed on lsusb but it doesn's show up on /dev/
I know it's in there somewhere, but I don't know much about how the USB subsystem works. :-(
nichomachus : Lubuntu 15.10
You'll need to enable the "Universe" packages in your sources list. You can either do it through the GUI or go to /etc/apt/[URL]st and uncomment the lines that say "universe" at the end, then run apt-get update and install the package.
I think it's the only way to get it for amd64 :)
it may very well be. I don't have 64bit
so... the only problem is that it's outdated?
yes.
thanks
its the lucid channel.. nps
tried replug. the numlock light stays on and none of the other keys respond.. Ill check BIOS settings though real quick.
hello. !details
but how to go to terminal ?
right click the desktop and the flux menu will appear.  as you get better with it you can add entrys to your menu as you wish
k i know what u mean... do u have wine setup right?
as far as I know im not missing anything. ive set up wine before, and it worked fine.
hmm... i dont really use wine much so i dont really know, but i know whenever firefox hits a page with lazy coding it does the same thing.. do u have enough memory free?
I have 4 gigs of memory, on a fresh install
thats not the prob then... I really dont know, sorry k
thanks for your help :)
So, I made another virtual hard disk and added it in settings. Windows detects new hardware but does nothing
try ubuntu instead?
Ubuntu is host, I need to use some windows application so I have XP in virtualbox
those apps run under wine?
jpilot
thanks
what is the install dir?
I don't know what that wants.. sorry?
klowner: im trying to add a drive to fstab so it l mount on startup
ok, so what part are you having trouble with?
klowner: well i just need to know what to put into fstab. /dev/sdb /media/NONE. thats all i know so far
do you actually want to mount it to /media/NONE or woudl something like... /mnt/externaldrive be more appropriate?
the drive is named none, and i already have samba shares set up with the name none so i would perfer to keep mounting it as NONE
ah, well ok
but what would i place after those lines? anything?
next step would be determining what filesystem is on the drive
how would i go about that, im guessing its ntfs but just to be sure
ah, if it's NTFS I would recommend installing ntfs-config.  it helps set up ntfs drives
ok installed, where do i go from there
run it, pop open a terminal and type ntfs-config
ok check the boxes enable write support for external device?
I think so, yes :)
klowner: ok checked and hit ok
did it add a line to your fstab?
it did, im not sure what thogh.  i dont know if it added a line or just changed somthing, i still see nothing about my external in it though
[URL] your fstab and I'll take a look at it
: tried fstab by uuid and by /dev/sdc1, both fail. options tried so far "auto,hotplug,defaults 0 0"
is it ext2/3/4?
: mount -a only works after a replug of device.  : ntfs
good luck. i can't/won't help.
so that, If I were you is an exception
something like that  :).  read my whisper, seems it's 'were' :)
can i controll the fan with that
no
how do i do that?.  how do i do that?
are you using the command line to copy files?
Isn't there a more elegant way? :P.  how?
remove roaming, that's first. The network-manager will not work for wireless. Make sure the setup is not saying anything. It will skip.
but I don't want postfix to be installed on my system.
use ssmtp/msmtp/nullmailer instead mutt depends on at least one MTA
okay
apt-get install ssmtp mutt
how would I do that?
i don't know. i just said i don't think it's a huge deal.  google recreate packages database
Grub 2 (Ubuntu 9.10).  I've looked at /etc/grub.d/10_linux but it looked like pure detection code, no static entry as far as I could see
sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg
That file is generated by update-grub
then locate the line kernel and add your parameters: kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-15-generic root=UUID=7bb5d8e8-0833-4525-bea2-e871b46c1493 RO [URL]pnp=1 i8042.dumbkbd=1
Those settings would disappear the next time update-grub is executed (kernel upgrades etc.)
yep
maybe google has something on it ?.  you can record using vnc
i've tryed and nothings good
no.  i mean yeah keyboard and mouse
oh ... hmm, check the screensaver settings
i've read it on an operating system book
Linus used it to make Linux
ok, where is the page? Or you mean the off.  oh thanx :P
no problems - check it out - it's really, really useful.  there's an index at the top for easy reference :)
but that is jre, I need to run it with sdk. do the same rules apply?. I see it ;). it is the same
oh good, i've got no idea.... apart from being defensive, how's anyone supposed to be able to help you with that?. *offensive
is it still that shaky?
well, "beta"
sometimes a beta version runs more stable than the previous stable
that's very optimistic :-) do what you want, but i'd certainly wait for a proper release.
any suggest?. <>just linux-headers and linux-image
compile kernel from what source
<>from [URL] stable
and the connection to ubuntu is you are running workstation on it?. !uptime. !test
<>ubuntu is on my hard drive, and vmware-workstating is install on kernel 2.6.24 hardy working fine. Sorry if I couldn't answer your question right.
just curious as hardy is 24
and not that cmyk bull. pro level work. ??. whats that?
Exactly my point :)
it doesnt
won't do, it is inevitable!!!.  what's the problem?
they messing up ubuntu is the problem. they promiss to keep it so people know how to fix things and u cant in xserver now. and it sucks
but you can. What do you want to solve?
its not there.....
mine is here, run xorgconfig
i just note that x-window-system-core wasn't installed .... so i m installing it now
had you started internet update at installation time?
I was playing a dvd with VLC. vlc crashed. I closed it with xkill and after that no sounds can be heard. when I use xmms or something it acts like its playing the sounds, but nothing is really coming out.
try running: killall -9 vlc in the terminal.  vlc has a bug that, sometimes if it's killed via xkill, it will still remain as a running process in the background. you can test this, if you run 'ps aux | grep vlc'
it said "no process killed"
run that ps aux | grep vlc
joe 13681 0.0 0.0 2972 764 pts/1 S+ 19:44 0:00 grep vlc
huh. try restarting alsa?
10.04
ok got everything on the top right or not?
?
is shut down and log out in the system menu, where they should be really, but isn't the case with Ubuntu as of 9.04
your not making sense
its telling you that the applet has crashed
im trying to install the drivers for my linksys wmp54g
sorry, never done that
oh yeah, that's ok then, just no dvd or data?
burns dvd and data fine aswell
not that i've used it, what's the major difference?
difference from what? ;)
from the windows version?
i didnt use nero that much in windows for the last year or so... mostly used DVD Decrypter
ahh, ok, thanx for the info :)
but the GUI i'd say is very diff...
no doubt, maybe I'll check it out, does my windows serial work?
im not sure, i'm runing "demo version" it'll expire 31/8
It's a game called tibia
is the launcher running a script that then runs the game?
I was looking at the .desktop entry spec mabye the StartupWMClass option? I don't know. yes.
java game?
I know that it's NTFS, Do I just simply mount it in my fstab
use the link and do as it says
hi, thanks! ... no. I installed it through Ubuntu (don't remember which application).  I also tried startx in the shell, but there was no luck: it says there's no screen
through jockey (hardware installer). ok. start up the computer and hold shift while it boots. at the grub menu, select recovery mode, then at hte next window, drop to root without networking. from there, type nano /etc/modprobe.d/[URL]nf. then go to hte bottom of the file and add "blacklist nouveau" without quotes. then hit control+o and control+x to exit.. then reboot.  also, type nvidia-xconfig. once in the terminal. sudo nvidia-xconfig
can i define that in the script ?.  can i define that in the script ?
you have to run the script as root sudo -c 'bash /path/to/script'
yes usb is working
what laptop?
I know, thats why I ask :-)
I was gonna say xmms2 then remembered that it's console based
ssh: connect to host myip port 22: Connection refused. i am wondering if sshd is working properly
sounds as it doesn't. you had been connected once, all other attempts failed. check /var/log/messages or syslog on server for any sshd-related errors
gone?? no i still see it sitting there in the bay! ;)
=)
I was hopng for some help. not jokes.
I wasn't joking, if you experience that kind of problem maybe your drive is broken. I don't think it's ubuntu fault
oh. thank you ill try it in another machine. thanks.
try with some other dvd disc
thanks, so installing it to the external would make me have to boot it from the bios every time? Is there a quicker way?
not from the bios, but from the bios boot menu. There should be a quick menu for that. so you don't have to go into the bios itself
are those users in here?
er, those are the programs ;)
would you mind telling me more? :)
: actually I found it some time ago and bookmarked it but now I cannt find it
ok. ok. i guess i'll stick to copying the files. thanks though
you can READ from ntfs fine
sorry i don't understand you
you want a function that will read your text file and split each newline as an array element for your for loop
how can I make gnome, the taskbar and everything else start on display 1?. on which is tightvnc
Xnest?. man Xnest. must use vnc?
yes, how do I start gnome there. what's xnest?
you see manpages first.. make sure it fit you. then ask question.
okay, that should resolve?
should get you to the install screen at least
i'll try it, if i'm lucky i won't be back. if not, i'll return with more info. thanks Init!
np. whats the offtopic room again?
Canary build aka "android-studio-canary".  it just download the zip file and fails matching SHA checksum
thought of git pull and ./configure ?
i can't find the package =/
It's in main. Are you connected to the internet? pastebin the output of `sudo apt-get update`
vlz_: hehe, for some reason irssi doens't auto-complete your nick.
I am in text mode now, yey
its a server install of 11.10
then do as I said...
no its a desktop

how is that not specific? If I have a bunch of directories (folders) with contents in them and I want to copy the folders to another location but as empty (without the contents), is it possible?
ls /proc/ post the output
what is that?
open a console.  write ls /proc/ and tell me what it says
I know it's console, but what are we trying to accomplish with that command?
ls is list.  /proc/ is a directory
oh, you mean replace /proc/ with my desired directory?
yes
that a package I can apt-get install?
that is the package
It was really minimalistic, and you could only resize notes by dragging the bottom left corner.  Unfortunately it's neither tomboy nor gnotes. however, I'm rather sure it was a GTK/gnome app
sticky-notes
oh I see.  How to disable it?
Comment out the 'start on' section.
so Ubuntu does not honor sysv runlevel system, I should not count on what I see in sysv-rc-conf, right?
Ubuntu uses upstart, but I believe it still uses runlevels.
Is there a tool for /etc/init like sysv-rc-conf for /etc/init.d?.  how can I know what services is enabled and what is not?
initctl list ?
How can I configure what services to start ?
sudo service <name> start ?
But it's not breezer,
make sure you don't "leapfrog" releases -> hoary -> breezy -> dapper
oh. hm. will have to look
gdm is the login screen
with what app?
no idea, search add/remove or synaptic for one that will work :)
and how about lspci ... ?
your adapter should be listed if its apci device
thanks
it probably isnt, though so yeah :P
i could do some nice howto's
Great idea! go for it
k lemme try starting it.  ermm how i start the network manager applet manualy ?
I just hinted at the answer: not worth finding out. Just use GNOME :)
i wanna use e17,
but if you are adventurous, try "nm-applet" from command line. It either starts or fails..  or maybe it's called network-manager-applet or Network-Manager-applet. I'm not quite sure what they call that little thing.
nm-applet it is.  well i guess its running, but since i can't see it anywhere hehehe
if it starts, then good. You can probably force it to start somehow at beginning of session. If it doesn't work, you're probably out of luck with respect to that..  and I state again: don't use e17. It's stupid.. Not supported. Nonsense. Just wastes time.
hmm.  ok, can ya help me on a related topic ?/.  if i don't wanna use nm=applet for using my wireless on gnome, what are the alternatives ?
By the way, is e17 the enlightenment version they've been working on for at least 5 years? Or is it more now?
i tried wicd on gnome, it detected by wireless, but never connected, it authenticated etc. but always got stuck on the getting ip address part.  hehe no idea
wicd, or somehow configure nm-applet to start the connection even when the applet isn't running. It's possible somehow, but I don't know the tools too well
thanks'

Google doesn't have no log policy
my guess is, Cox is redirecting genio's URL's.  log policy?
I am saying, meanying, every website you visit the query DNS on Google public DNS is logged
who cares? If you don't like it, don't use it.
So, imho, it's unsafe to always point folks to Google Publis DNS
you are right. It is your opinion.
You are right, you don't care about your anonymity but it's foolish to assume others don't
it's called troubleshooting
What do you mean - if it works?
well, i mean the adapter might not be recognized... but hopefully it will
dmesg says: [URL]
then it should definitely be recognized at /dev/ttyUSB0
So I can tell other software that they can find the serial device in /dev/ttyUSB0?
yes.
The problem Is I have connected a weather station to that port. But when I run wview and tell it to use this address, the daemons start, but it says its still starting. and I cant get it to work.. Like it would be waiting for some packets ir sth :S
it might be waiting for some flow control signal that never gets activated. have a look at the flow control options. you should probably also try debugging using the package "minicom" (a simple terminal emulator)
what is flow control, and what exactly do I have to try? Sorry i'm such a newbie.. I just really want to set up the weather station..
it might end up being a bit complicated. serial ports (the RS232 interface) have a pin or two that are used to say "yes, i'm here, i'm a serial device, and i'm ready to send/receive". those are called RTS/CTS (ready to send / clear to send). alternatively, another method of flow control is called XON/XOFF, and doesn't use any additional pins.  it's possible, for example, that your program expects RTS/CTS signals, but those aren't carried by the adapter.
I just installed minicom. What can I do with it?
how you would tell your software to ignore them... i don't know that..  you can try to see the raw output that's coming from the serial port, if any.
how do I change the port on minicom?
i don't really remember these details
Ok. then how do I see what information is it sending?
SaintSapp: you can use grep... but what do you mean by "integer"? you can give grep a hex value, i suppose
i have install new icon, but how to install?. i have download a new icon, but how to use it?, sry did write wrong, my bad
what are you trying to create a launcher for?
what command?
try running this>> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<<
nope. says Unreconized Command
then I guess your install is not complete have you removed the CD?
no. the config says its not a linux Cd. THERE IS GAIM. TARD~
that error I have seen once - and only once - what version is that CD?
v 5.04
be better if you did 5.10 the new as of a couple of weeks ago
well im waiting for my cds then
the disk you have if I am correct is actually a hoary colony cd not the actual haory release.  I may not be
i dont know. i got it posted to me
how long ago?.  or by whom?.  got broadband?
okay, thanks.
The command you are looking for is, likely, "xdg-open ~"
ok, let me find that
Since you'll need to enter a command for the shortcut
will do.. brb ;-).  so im thinking i should use usermod to change my uid then use chown on my home file like so: chown -hR  /home/. seems like that would work?
yup, if ownership is the problem
its a brand new cd just first touched by human hands.  should i md5 it or something?
I know dapper beta liveCD's has a "check cd for defects" option when booting up, but Im not sure if theres something like that on breezy ones...
using the command "vncserver"
then vncserver -kill :1 or whatever number it reported on start
any slowness issues on your machine or gnome locking up?
which Macbook Pro and which Release?
running 7,1 with maverick and the mactel ppa support installed.  see last
Ah. I have the 8,1 running Xubuntu natty
ok...i dont want to create the user...he already exists...just add eic to group www-data and thats it....does adduser eic www-data do just that?
"adduser user group" "man adduser".  read part "Add an existing user to an existing group"
ok...and how can i then see what groups a user is member of?
group/id.  groups/id
command groups/id does not work
2 commands, both work
everything was working famously until I installed those. which was the only change I had made prior to the last reboot it had
It may be that in the process of writing exposed something corrupt in the filesystem, or a bd block on the disk...
and I will certainly look into that after removing those packages. XD. just to be certain
You will probably need to get around the filesystem errors first, the package problem is secondary in this case...  The filesystem which has failed, are there critical data on it?
I'm still not convinced that installing a package uncovered some underlying problem. there must be a way to uninstall a package with a live cd, chroot perhaps?
I recently had a discussion about what to recommend users in this case, might be worth a read, sine the dicision on how much precaution to take is yours: [URL]
nothing useful. it's not an x error.  x is working fine, but gdm wont run
then you've checked that you can get to working gnome session with startx?
yes, already mentioned that.. who is good at debugging "gdm" it reports to start [ok] but all i get out of it is, it starts x to the cursor and then x exits. no error messages, nothing. (btw startx works for all accounts) ?. repost ^
and what's in the gdm logs?
and, thank you for your answer about cloning. the /dev/source I will want to use the actual parititon, right? as in /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdd1 ... correct?
correct. so something like dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1
ok, thanks. just wanted to be sure. for some reason I haven't had much luck with this so far.
partitions are the same size?
well, not yeat. *yet.  do they need to be?. I thought perhaps it would kill the partition on the 2nd drive ie overwrite it
target should be equal or greater
ok. I can do that.
did you get any error message? you said you 'haven't got any luck'? What happened?
I repartitioned the target drive and now (I hope) the partition is being cloned; I had trouble coming up with the correct "dd" command for some reason - part of the problem was the drive was dying. whenever I set out to make a 3rd back up for offsite invariably the original drive starts to die. it's just weird.
oh oh. if you have a dying drive, have a look at dd_rescue. Might get headaches else if the drive is flaky and errors out on accessing some sectors.
command not found
are you using ubuntu?
where can I see that?. sorry. default route is the same of the host

Ok thank you =D
it's the only real reason to install those fonts, otherwise they're flippin' useless...
it doesn't see it, it sees the mic but not that cam, I'm running SimplyMEPIS Linux and everything BUT the cam worked just fine, I'm a No0b to linux
if dmesg doesnt see it, then it won't work. That means there's no driver for the webcam chipset in the current kernel

:)
VNC over VPN for instance.. Does it slow it down significantly?
depending on your bandwidth, rdesktop could slow things down a bit. what's your bandwidth?. you have pptp and ipsec for VPNs as well. ipsec offers much more security but is more difficult to set up under linux
I'm actually thinking more in general.
again, what's your bandwidth?
Thanks.
works just the same
kernel -25 is killing me, and I keep getting caught out with software updates :-).  Get a stable system going, "la de da - software updates" - Oh holy smurf!
iirc having either linux-image-<arch> or linux-<arch> is what pulls in the new kernels, with out those no new kernels
Without those in pref? Surely you need to exclude them using prefs rather than include them?
uninstall those packages
application/x-httpd-php phtml pht php
theres more lines with php
[URL]
same as mine
ah ok.  this is really odd IMO
-> are you typing file:///fullpathtofile ? notice the 3 ///
yes i did have 3 '/'
and what does your about:config tells you under mime ?
can't copy and paste the values.  but ive got 3 lines that filter on mime
you can tell me, itheres only two lines
/etc/mime.types, and ~/.mime.types
same as mine..
there are a load of symlinks in /etc/alternatives. but I'm not sure if there's an automagical way to manage them
update-alternatives?
i dont know what's going on with this version : 12.04 : << ehh it seems i am done
ask your question
i have too many issues , i installed dockbarx and i doesnt work too , i installed ubuntu tweak but i can not see gnome sitting dont tell me search cos if you said that i will break this screen
where did you get dockbarx
from that site [URL]. i installed it in version 10.04 it works + its great there
if you are new to linux i would recommend you get all software from the software center
well that's okay but i can't find what i want in software center not all the time !
its free
so i dont think there's answer for my question. that's why people call ubuntu truck then
are you trying to install a theme
from another ubuntu system
what happens when you try to access the files?
FSC desktop. proc. celeron 2,6, 512mb ram?. I can set the idle timeout at screensavers
Your computer is sort of outdated... Have you thought of Lubuntu?
shoot. I'm already installing ubuntu. err. gnome. I already entered sudo apt-get install gnome-core. should I just delete it after it is done running?. in the console?. because it is at like 58%
gnome-core is not that bad, but the -desktop is rich with programs. !info gnome-core. 'essential' so you can add all you favorite programs, and keep it small. gnome-core would be my ( experienced) choise
Sooo
sooo, your good :-)
so there is functionally no difference between gnome-core. and ubuntu-gnome-desktop. ?
just the amount of programs standard
Oh.... I've already installed a bunch of programs. will I have to reinstall them in gnome desktop?
no, if you installed VLC or Chromiu,, they will appear. c/Chromium
banshee. i ahve all the codecs installed from medibuntu, shouldn't that apply to banshee?
ok, you need to install the GStreamer proprietary codecs
i thin kit already downloaded and installed tht on its own
hmmm.  have you rebooted or logged out since it installed that package ?
umm no i dont thin kso
try rebooting or logging out and see if it changes anything
you think I should try rebooting?. ok ill check
if it does not then there may be another issue. sometimes it fixes things
ok let me try that
it may or may not work. worth a try though
hopefully it does =/
yeah I know what you mean. I like the media features in Ubuntu personally so I'm hoping this isn't a common problem
sudo /bin/hostname newhostname
ok do you still have localhost in /etc/hosts
: http logs ?? i want monitor all possible data .. like post method get method and ... !!
yes, so you can see that in the httpd logs
yeah  i just saw that, but it says that the wireless NIC's are 'untested'
on all pages? not all of them are updated. and which of them was untested?
both of the g3 pages
i heard that there are drivers availiable for the Airport card
uh. can i use ndiswrapper maybe ?
you are better of it
what?
*better of without it
yes
does your webcam work with cheese?
it captures the input, yes, but CPU is up to 100%, so it is practically useless
did you try to run cheese on terminal to see if you get any strange output?
i get some warnings and an error
and if you run skype on terminal, do you get similar error?
no.  this is what i get with cheese: [URL]
do you know what is that file cheese tries to open?
it seems an ogg video, i don't know why it wants to open that, the Reason translates as: the data stream does not contain any data.  i've deleted all items, now cheese does not give any output in terminal
and does it consume too much cpu?
yes.  around 90%
so no error nor warning but still consuming too much cpu?
exaclty
mmmhh.  and what about skype output?
Oh I kinda thought that the sun java plugin wasnt available any more..  What partner repo?
it's just been moved to partner -- icedtea is the open source web plugin in you are interested
No I actually would rather have sun
see blue note at top of [URL]
That can run on an ubuntu server, no gui
[URL]
Not very long, why?
a long cable can cause ghosting ... as can a cheap cable. make sure the cable isnt running near any power cables aswell
It was ok in windows, about 30 mins ago.
have you tried using the nv driver - does it still have ghosting?
yes it does. im sure it has something to do with the horiz and vert values i have set, but they seem to have worked last time.. and they are the correct values from the monitor manual.
what resolution are you running?
1280x1024. at 60hz
is it ghosting @ 800x600
No not at all. Perfect Display at 800x600
then i'm guessing either the refresh isnt high enough or the screen cant handle 1280x1024
it must be the refresh but i have had it working before in ubuntu with 1280x1024 @60hz. this is what i cant understand
i wouldnt recommend 60hz anyways ... its bad for your eyes. check your xorg.cfg file and check the values are correct there
no normal hdd
well you can try supergrub live cd to try and fix it.  or the ubuntu live cd
yank you ever heard of a module being linked like a shortcut to a file
yes
ahhh you know how that command would go?.  I'm pretty much working with a user manual and trying to figure out how this thing works
You'd use "ln" to accomplish this task...but be ABSOLUTELY sure of things...mucking about with symbolic links can get, er, a bit puzzling at times...especially if you're not taking notes (somewhere)
Yeah I know ln does get interesting, and I am taking notes, it's for work so everything is being documented.
Make copies of the notes! Just in case (mistakes can be made)
have you used midori
No. I need a browser, not a pain.
from terminal?
yes
good lord.. maybe i should have |less'd that....  k, now what?
ctrl-c to stop it
it finished already.
see if you find what you're looking for. in that list
the files or the folder?
if you find the file, it may lead you to the folder
Lisa? Hi, what is drummer?. Sorry Lisa I don't know what drummer is????
sorry it was joke,
but what stops the program from renaming it the said files after reading then- note this user has: read write and execute permission in this folder.  he might not have permission to delete it, but once it can read the file and it has a write permission why can't it just make a copy of it with another another name?
yeah i just tried it, having rwx to a dir lets you delete the files if you want.  maybe just give him access to a subdir that he can create files in and possibly delete or rename?
so no solution even a theoretical solution/suggestion?.  let me try to tell what we are working on
well, you can do sudo chattr +i /path/to/file to make it immutable. he can't delete or rename it then or chattr -i it, i've not done this before so ask around before depending on it maybe
it's theory on how to protect the entry files from manipulation by a rough AI, which is just a smart program that has read permission to a given folder.  but it can make copies and rename them right? then we still have a problem
it's becoming inconsistent though, what you're asking
I now chattr -i I don't it would help
you want him to be able to read files, and you want to give him write permission to the dir, then logically he can read/copy it and make another file with another name
no it's not
it doesn't add up imo
i'm using Windows
then use anything you want. and download it.  if you still don't trust the iso, check md5sum
Daz: I'm using Firefox to download it, but it stops downloading everytime.  Is using torrent a good way?
then torrents maybe
thanks
ubuntu website has a torrentfile
It tries to remove other stuff too. So I just want to disable the service. Not sure if /sbin/chckconfig is compatible in Ubuntu...
What other stuff? (Does it matter?
I am not 1000% sure but its called bluecherry-desktop and I do not want to remove it. I just want to disable the pulseaudio from hell without deleting it right now
chkconfig ?.  I'm not 1000% sure either, but just remove it.
No. Can you just answer the question? How do I disable a service in Ubuntu?
What does chkconfig have to do with any of this?
I want to disalbe the /etc/init.d/pulseaudio service. and in my system theres no /sbin/chkconfig
Just uninstall it. What's the problem?
IT WANTS TO REMOVE PACKAGES THAT **I** DONT WANT TO REMOVE
Why not?
because I dont want to
YOu can always re-install later on if you want them back..  Ok, never mind.
well i have the movie ripped. alla ia need is a program that puts the subs into the avi
Well, acidrip will rip a DVD movie and put the subtitles into the .avi file with the movie as long as you have the Subtitle drop down menu engaged in the "Other Stuff" section. But I don't know how to do it if you already have the movie ripped.
is there a prog for win, so as to run it with wine?? (or try to...)
I don't know.. I haven't touched Window in about 7 years.
yea
you can do online resizing of ext2,3 partitions then
thank you
np :)
what is that.  flashsupport
its called libflashsupport
yes indeed.. I have tried using the flashplayer-update cmd and that gives and error
proxy error?
stating something about networking may have changed?.  can't recall off the top of my head... sec:
make sure you don't have a proxy set for wget connections. Check with 'env | grep -i proxy' and look in /etc/wgetrc
proxy is set to on ;/. #use_proxy = on. bah
no, it's not set if there is a # at the beginning of the line
i am using 2 OS on 2 seperate harddrive now, one is windows xp, the other is ubuntu
what about swap? this isn't System V, your swap isn't going to fill up.. if you're worried about swap getting in the way of other things just tack it on before the ubuntu paritions or after them
I'll make an alias _if_ i can figure that out.
I'll look into it, too.
Sweet.
Hmm...difficult problem this.
Aye. it is.
Just out of curiosity. Why do you want it that way? As in what data do you want to view?
Superfilus & extenoius data I wish to filter out from my constant ls -l 's.
ls -a?
it isnt safe then. right
depends who you ask...
slim?
!info slim
is it clean and fuss free?
pretty much
I respectfully disagree :)
/bin;/usr/bin;/usr/local/bin;/sbin;/usr/sbin I'd assume
or maybe not. I have set stuff in my .bashrc that it doesn't use. where do I need to set it?
how are you setting your path in .bashrc?
PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/bin:$PATH, and export PATH
export PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/bin:$PATH
that's the same I think. at least the path works like it should in a shell
odd
thx
what is printed on the plastic case is moot, the chip is what you need to drive
thx mmt please.  [URL]
ok its a RTL-8139
I have found open source driver shipped by a producer, but had trouble compiling it
its using the driver=8139too driverversion=0.9.28 duplex=full ip=83.240.54.142.  so it appears to be working
well so then must be a trouble with wicd
can you ping 38.99.130.180
yes I can
then dns is failing.  run: gksudo gedit /etc/[URL]nf and add these 2 lines.  nameserver 8.8.4.4.  nameserver 8.8.8.8.  save the new file and try the web.  those are google's DNS servers.  easy addresses to remember
as in in the terminal?
Yep
do I need to specify frames per second?
Apparently. What is it you're trying to do?
or just mplayer filename -fps.  trying to play a m2ts file.  when I try to play it without the option I get audio but not visual
It says the header information is invalid or missing, so it may be that the file is screwed up.  Have a look at this thread: [URL]
I've also got a .moff and a .modd file.  would they help?
That's something I don't know. Check that thread out for some possible solutions.
crontab?.  you sure?
that's how I would do it.. there might be other ways too, of course
can you walk me through it?
sure
what about at?
sure.. at should work too.. I've never used it myself though
how would crontab
when I think of it.. at might be the better solution.. have you tried it?
im not sure how to use it.  its confusing
hmm.. let me have a quick look at the man page.. just a sec
any idea?
hmm.. the man page wasn't that informative.. give me another minute to try it.  ok.. here's an idea.. write this "at 06:00" or whatever time you want to command to run.  then press enter.. you should get a new line that starts with at>.. now you write the command you want to execute.. press enter and then press CTRL+D when you're finished.  as far as I can tell that should work
it does, without any doubt whatsoever.. I've used it for years
chetic maybe the driver is old
same with 1024x768, it can do more than 60Hz but that's all I can choose.. well that and 43.  I just downloaded and installed the driver! if you mean the graphics driver
yes
ok, tell me url, i'll put your howto and a spanish howto of a friend of mine. i'll put links, i mean
[URL]
and i and my friend, will review the wiki.  it's better to use qemu-mkcow than dd. mkcow is dynamic, so it grows as you need
oh, ok. ah. edit away!
:). wait, i wanna read entirely first.  very good indead, i only want to add "mkcow" line
though
no 13.04
There is no nightly for 13.04
i just installed it.. ?
check the date, it has been released the nightly's stop then.
sorry, what do you mean "it has been released the nightly's stop then"?
I can't say it any clearer.
but if it was 1 would it be like 100%?!
not really...
what it would be then/
as far as I can tell, 1.0 load means your system is doing the optimal amount of proccessing for your system, but even that doesnt seem right
60.00 which is the recommended for my monitor
do u have sync to VBlank in nvidia open gl settings?
yes
take it off and see if its less jerky :D
ok, trying that no. *now.  it doesn't make a difference :(
dunno why it's jerky then if it works on games. Maybe you have too many processes open == low ram
you can double click on the application, so no.  it's just linked to wine
have you tried running it from the command prompt using sudo?
that's a good idea, let me try that.  it just crashed my program...
the only thing that I can think of would be playing around with sudo to get the permissions right, but I've never installed wine so I'm not exactly an expert
whats the name?
shoudl be in your taskbar. gnome-network-monitor, methinks
that thing only monitors network.. i wanna know how fast the connection of my 802.11g is. it fluctuates as i move through my house
if you click on the thingy in the taskbar, it will show you the strength :-)
I know I have one but I need to install it on a virutal machine because I dont want to get rid of xubuntu
have you installed virtualbox or vmware?
it's not being detected by the gnome "Add a Printer" dealy, and when i set it up manually it doesn't appear.
what printer?
epson stylus C86. bv dfguu\\
I think you will need gimp-print
its empty
is there a .Trash* on the drive?
yes.  yes
and instide there is nothing?
no there is files in it
delete them?
i just did still didnt work
how are you determining that?
I don't know how to do that without an internet connection!!!
.. ah... just found out there is no more -386 flavor. try booting with a nosmp boot argument. !boot
i was removing libbluetooth3 ( so i could remove bluetooth support ) and also iphone libs both want to remove gvfs-backends
couldbe its a meta package that just pulls in other stuff. Not sure how you would check that.
beagle?.  - whats the best tool for looking through a folder or multiple folders of files for a files that contain say "TEXT"
kingsy101 u mean any file or a strip of text within the file?
- yea, any text within the searched files that matches say "text" the filename would be returned
captain_ download emerald to use with compiz.. if u want, or u can download gtk themes. kingsy101 im not sure ive done it once... ill try looking in find manual
- thanks
kingsy101 i cant find it in finds manual... so cant help u with that..
my mistake. its gnome classic
12.10 has a lvvm feautre of compiz for non3d supported devices
i pointed to the sources as outlined in the guid
then, if it still doesn't work: apt-get -f install
i did the update and it seems connection refused on 1 source
and if that doesn't do it, can you please show me the error again and what you're trying to do
following about the 3rd step of this guide: [URL] i get vncserver: Depends: xserver-common but it is not going to be installed. E: Broken packages
what does: apt-get install xserver-common say?
thanks  I think I just found out here: [URL]
you can sometimes get a clue by looking at the browser cache
how do I get output from mount? -v?
no parameters
/dev/hda4 on /media/xtra type reiserfs (rw)
good, it's rw (read write)
location based gnome time?. gah, okay, please substitute my wording for the new indicator.  do you know how to show gmt indicator in time zone applet?
i no longet use applets, only indicators
do you know how to show gmt indicator in time zone indicator?. lol
:S
thanks
pleasure . did it work?
yes it did
kk.  : [URL]at/view/42e73edc
it's not really a bug though. that seems a bit inappropriate
bugs can be "wishlist"
i have a partition sdb1 i want to mount on login with the label Data Drive, it is ntfs
sudo mkdir /media/Data_Drive no spaces
okey, then what.  did it,
add to fstab /dev/sdb1 /media/Data_Drive ntfs-3g users,auto,uid=1000,gid=100,umask=007 0 0
okey lets try
mount -a should read the fstab again.  remove any other sdb1 mounts in fstab
thanks. I've been googling around but not sure where the symbolic link's broken for gtk
do you have libcanberra0 installed?.  also libcanberra-gtk0 libcanberra-gtk-module and related dev pacakges
I have libcanberra pre-installed with jaunty 64 bit. it's under /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules.
mm let me search more hold on
the first problem I've encountered is the 32-bit flash plugin complains about wrong ELF class for this module which I think it is a 64 bit module.
are you running 64 but?. bit. sorry
yes I am. Jaunty 64 bit. I did have ia32libs installed and they seem to work fine
I am seeing many hits in google about this but no solutions have you tried ##gnome?
i did. tried to figure this out for the past weeks but no dices. it seems like gtk 2.0 for jaunty 64 bit is broken somewhere..  this also affects chromium browser.
oh man... I have no experience with the 64 bit at all ...here...all my systems are 32 bit.... I will keep searching.  yes I read a bug report about chromium as well.  check this [URL]  sorry no solution there hold on
yep, same problems. Someone told me to hang on and wait for the updates for the Gtk. currently i can't run any gtk based 32-bit applications in jaunty.
oh man...that's painful :(.  I am still searching though
thanks  for helping out. What I am trying to do now is to find out where it tells gtk to find the modules. If I can find out where the configuration file is, maybe I can tweak a little bit to let it find the 32-bit version.
sounds reasonable
kind of regret of upgrading to jaunty from fedora. didn't expect an error like this.
would sudo ldconfig help?
tried that, no entries for loading module section.
darn.  well I havent used fedora for some time so I cant speak about the differences ...you probably see them immediately
i like ubuntu for the easy installation but it just happens that the 9.04 seem to have some problems i guess. it uses python2.6 instead of python2.5 in ubuntu. All my old apps were based on 2.5. So I had to do some seriously tweaking to make jaunty work..  but the fast boot up is impressive~ thanks to kernel 2.6.28
that almost sounds useless... did you consider going back to fedora until 9.10?.  oh :).  did you say you had all of the -dev pacakges installed for libcanberra?
well, already spent so much time tweaking jaunty. will try to stick around for a little longer. hope that doesn't happen. :-)
understood :)
yep, the whole gtk packages including dev version.
ok just checking
i want to do it for all networks; i'm travelling; so i'm connecting to new networks daily
then you'll need to edit /etc/dhcp/[URL]nf so it'll be applied for all networks
that ges regenerated daily doesnt it.  after i change that how do i get networking to restart so that it will use the new name servers?
no, it's used by the DHCP client (the program used to request an IP address/DNS servers from the network).  just disconnect and reconnect.  you want to put something like "supersede domain-name-servers 12.34.56.78, 12.34.56.79" in there, above the line starting with "request"
what do you mean? I want to stop amarok from starting up at boot, but I can't find it in the Sessions gui thing
how did you make it start up at boot/
umm not really sure what you mean, but I installed ubuntu via wubi
how did you make amark start up automatically?
can u plz give me the command??
if packages are in same folder then sudo dpkg -i *deb
russian
did you know about #ubuntu-ru ? you may want to try them first, if they don't help you, try here
does it matter?.  yes I know about ubuntu-ru. they know nothing about this problem, so I decided to ask here
it doesn't matter, but your question was hard to understand..  can you explain your question better?
sorry, I thought it's a know issue on a 8.10 better
what ubuntu are you using, what did you do, what happened, what did you expect should happen
[URL] here is the description of new ubuntu 8.10 and they say about a bug with gnome look. I have the same, but has not found how to fix it.
you are on intrepid?
so those are all the dependencies I must download?
Make sure that you put in the meta-package that you have.
then I just do dpkg -i * for all of those dependencies?
Yes.
what is a meta package?
A package that doesn't contain any data itself, but just depends on other packages. So for a desktop install, it would be ubuntu-desktop.
this thing isn't making a whole lot of sense. It is telling me I need to download a .deb, but I know those debs have dependencies.
So what did you enter in the fields?
for example I need to install package apache2-mpm-worker (it's one of apache2's dependencies) and the metapackage for all apache is apache2
The metapackage field is for metapackages that you already have installed.
does it take two accounts eg msn and gtalk?
yes yahoo,gmail,msn, etc etc etc lots of facebooke too etc
problem is when they are both connected i dont know how to switch to the gtalk window
gtalk? it is not gtalk it is only empathy.
well the account i meant
switch means? you can enable or disable them. you can know chich contacct in online from which account
ah ok there was none online from the gtalk account, silly me
:)
What about wireless?. It worked on 11.04, it doesn't work now.
Please define 'wireless does not work'
thanks
if it keeps locking, you can try running it under a debugger. but as far as checking on a past event, I don't think so
where can I go to learn about running it under a debugger? I can debug it no problem once I get it going, but getting it set up is where I'm lost.
man gdb
ty,
no problem
For the mp3 player;)
it doesn't play mp3s at high bitrates?
when I right click it tries to open it
that's... not right..  how do you usually change hte properties of an item??.  you are using Gnome, right?
they're listed under places. Yes, I'm using Gnome
ooh, listed there!.  can you go to network servers and do it from there?. BRB
i see. no i mean mac address
?
so my mac address for my wlan and eth comes assigned from the manufacturer?
mac addresses are hard coded into the cards by the manufacturer.  yes
okay. thanks.
what are you trying to do?.  [URL]  the ip address is different
i was just want to know that the default mac address assigned by manufature is enoush secure? because if we get combination permutation then there will be limited number of addresses? (as we end with ip address) so then it may happen that two or more devices may have same mac addresses?.  i know.  i am not talking about ip i am talking about mac
it doesn't matter in that regard.  unless you have trillions of network devices all on the same network
okay
your mac address isn't sent out over the net. The routers is.  then the router redirects the traffic when it gets back
do you have by any chance the APA style there?.  it in /usr/share/lyx/layout.  it in /usr/share/lyx/layouts
yes
I dont have it can you send it to me please?
no, sorry
yea it gives me an error in my log about switching to that user.
does that user exist and have an smbpass created?
yea user erin was created and did smbpasswd -a.  [2011/10/10 18:20:43.439308, 0] smbd/uid.c:310(change_to_user). PANIC: assert failed at smbd/uid.c(310): conn->force_group_gid != (gid_t)-1
ah ok, that's about the extent of my knowledge then, assuming you've restarted tha daemon since and also tried testparm for a laugh
it's ok I can just change the permissions on ssh I guess. seems like a bug in the software ( I did see it but they said something about the gid bit on some directory caused it however I don't really know what that means.
does that user, erin, have read permissions on the share path?
yea ;/ the dir is owned by x:x but it is 777
erk =E tried forcing the owner to erin:erin just for a test?
nah, im just going to be storing a few images of hard drives so I can chang the permissions to -w or whatever manually later. it needs to be x:x since it stores movies etc for my home theater ;\
ah ok. i do the same thing by having the group owner as a group "server" that all the users are a member of
hrm.. what ? :-). I usually use nfs but my gf insists on having a windows computer so I gotta use samba too -.-
so say i want 3 users on something, the permissions are 760 or 660, with owner nobody:group - where "group" = "server". then, the share in the samba config has a parameter "forcegroup = server" and "createmask = 0660" or so to force it
uh, so have the group of the file the name of my server machine, like (Media)?
it's the name of the "group" account you create, then assign all your users to :D
the machine is a new one, the vesa driver works (but 800x600 is not funny) and the previously installed windows worked too
that doesn't rule out bad hardware
i tried
Install the "HPLIP" package and run "hp-setup"
no I have not thanks for the tip. The reason I am asking is because when I backup my music files using any file copy the files become corrupt when transferring them all at once... if I transfer just one file or folder, the files are fine
yeah im kinda a noob at rsync so i couldnt be of much more help than that
ok, thanks... I am going to give grsync a try
Unison is nice too, if you search synaptic for unison, you'll see it has a gui too Unison-GTK or something
: no i have this problam with all program
go to menu>system>preferences>sounds.  there go to sounds tab and enable ESD
: this checkbox enabled before
ok go to devices tab - you got pulse audio or alsa
: what should i do ?
see in the devices tab if you have pulse audio or alsa selected.
: autodetect selected , but i think it use alsa
change everything to ALSA then check
: i change all to alsa but , i have that problam yet.  : can you help me ?
I googled a bit for your problem but no specific answers looks like its a bug
: can i ask this again?.  : can i ask it again?
?
yes please
did you install it from apt?
no its pre installed in my vps.  i have bout a new vps and configured bind, but i want bind to start at boot
is there a bind9 script in /etc/init.d/ directory
yes.  yes, there is
what ubuntu you running?
yes
ouch.. any erros? did you turn up IGain in alsamixer?
alsamixer did not came up after apt-get. derlire , should i try it again ?
right, but did it install?
yes
try it again. also try installing 'alsaconf' this can sometimes fix any weirdness
the interesting thing is soon get an accoustic feedback when in play with pcm output and mic input volume
hmm, well that's a start. you don't see the record meter rise in audacity or another recording application?
> the first step of troubleshooting in the documentation says to go to system > preferences > hardware, but that isn't there
-> what kind of wifi card? pci? usb? pcmcia?
> not sure
aaron-> you only want coming from your box and no new connection towards you. -> then i can only pull my crystal ball and guess wrong
13.5g. OLD lol :P
have you used another os on it recently?
yea
did you wipe everything first?
tnaks i did try that, but It doesn't seem to register the key ( ubuntu / unity)
Hm... I dunno, go to xev, see if pressing it actually generates any X event
ahhhh xev that was the name i was tring to remember :P. thanks.  first time i get the right answer by asking the wrong question hahaha
lol
wow xev didnt react to the keypress, I may need a driver or something
Suppose so yeah
i went to synaptec and it says its already installed...  well it says flash is already installed.  , just installed it now.. should i reboot?
usually reboots are only necessary after deep system updates... i would recommend you try it with google chrome, which has a own flash builtin
just did, didnt work.
ok. Next step i would recommend is starting browser by terminal and check for error-messages / warnings
(firefox-bin:2658): LIBDBUSMENU-GTK-CRITICAL **: dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set_shortcut: assertion `gtk_accelerator_valid(key, modifier)' failed
otherwise... well... maybe delete flash-profile? ($HOME/.adobe/...) reinstall flashplugin?.  doesn't sound like a relevant error.  which ubuntu btw? 64bit?
, yes 64bit
ati-card?
i think. NVIDIA.  whats that command to see what im running again?
uname -a , lsb_release -a
<unconvertable> is there any Biliard/Snooker games. <unconvertable>  this is the name of game right ?
yup...search more with 'apt-cache search billiard'
<unconvertable> any snooker game ?
flying and foobilliard
<unconvertable> when i <unconvertable> apt-cache search billiard its showing some game but how to install
'sudo apt-get install [package]' or use synaptic
is it litrally that code, or do i need to substitiute something?
no, the id -un does the substitution (your username)
yeah thats what I meant :D
i'm sure a client has that :P.  right now i'm just using pidgin, but... it's not the best i've used for irc
XChat is very good ...
anom0ly: it means it's been replaced/obsolete/unsupported.  funny... i have that installed but am not using it... :S
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found
@ what Ubuntu release are you running?
i did
sudo apt-cache search nvu?
when using dir - if theres a directory containing a space in the name (ex: The One ) it outputs The\ One....hide \
use ls then
Sorry for all the typos, will ndiswrapper in any way kill this card I have heard of people having this card die in Ubuntu.
Answer me this, how can a wrapper for a driver kill the card?
ah your right
it sounds like speculation to me.. i've used broadcom and NDIS before,.. and no issues.
thanks . where can i find ultravnc packages?
[URL]
lol  : ya i seen it. thanks.  1.0.4 rc12 is ok?
that's what I use iirc
Clean install with the help of hachre
Ecryption: did it fail on you with the default drivers on setup?
No it didn't. I just wanted to use the proprietary drivers. After I rebooted, Unity wouldn't show up. After a lot of help it finally did. Now when I reboot, it doesn't reboot like it should.
how about trying the recovery from grub
It doesn't show grub at all.
you can hold shift after bios post boot. to enter grub
Yeah that's the problem, no BIOS post. It just stays on a black screen with underscore when I reboot so I can't do anything.
no bios post doesnt relate to ubuntu, you should at least see post msg boot on your machine right
Nothing like that.
did you recently added new hardware on your machine?
When I click reboot, it doesn't shutdown to reboot. There's just a black screeen with an underscore. It says like that for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.. Nope I haven't.
can you see ubuntu boot or not?
Nope I don't see it boot
try hold shift after you press power on your machine to enter grub, see what happens
I can't shutdown either. If I try to, it's just a blackscreen with an underscore
you can hold your power button until your machine halts right. then reboot
yeah yeah
better go to #avr channel
ok, will it restart? or I just launch gnome-panel again?
i think it should kill it and gnome-panel should restart.  operative word.. should
can you explain how to do this. I'm pretty familiar with linux by now but I dont know what you mean by that
just run "grub" from the live cd. type "root (0,0)" or whatever , then setup (hd0) or whatever
I tried that but I don't know how to tell the ports
: try cd to /dev and inspect ttyUSBX with cat, e.g. cat ttyUSB0
are they in raid configuration? (just curious)
yes, 6 time 500gb. s
well I did a test cronjob (logging the date) that works. but the wine one doesn't
just add the line, the command is simply wine [win32program]
/usr/bin/wine /home/rob/mirc/mircstats.exe. ?
Yeah, something like that.  Do you use mirc for IRC on Linux?.  thats.. um... kinda odd
when updating, ubuntu sometimes makes change to menu.lst (new kernel etc), so I don't think that'll work if I just copy the menu.lst.
fair enough. Here is a (very old) guide on restoring grub: [URL]
ok, i'll check it out. thank you
np
- server install only, stuck at command line, sorry!
oh jeeze.  no idea
- thanks anyway
no problem
- do you think I could build the driver for the card in this laptop then transfer it over to the other and it would work?
perhaps.  but thats beyond my level
- didn't you know how to use ndiswrapper?
yup
will synaptic do the job, ?
gstreamer0.8-mad.  if you find em yeah
I have, repeatedly.
what filetype are you talking about
rtsp
ok and what is the problem
basically it says "Firefox doesnt know what to do because the protocol rtsp isnt associated with a program". no option to choose.  no option to choose nothing.
get mozilla-mplayer
Its an alert message.  I have that installed.
link to such an rtsp
[URL]/ go to "recent programs". under "video/audio"
I get a prompt that comes up and tells me it is an external protocol and asks me if I want to open it with totem and whether I want to associate it with totem automatically from now on.  do you have totem all codeced ought
I uninstalled totem. no totem
well do you have something that can handle it
I installed realplayer. you know the one who made rtsp
oh wow, vomit,
ok so how would I do them using apt-get command?
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
thanks.  I think its working :)
:)
would it be correct to write:" apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade" ?
apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade would be enough
the line in that that says 'candidate'?
yes
but as I said, I lost windows from the list
unlike LILO, if you edit menu.lst, grub updates the list on bootup automatically..  Oh, sad.. There's a GUI boot manager editor.
my session
System - Settings - Sessions.  think that's the proper translation...
well how do I get it working
[URL]
yea I did that
well, what is the problem?
well cedega doesn't even run
well, that necessarily doesn't have anything to do with it
and I cannot select which resolution. I want
what does "glxinfo | grep direct" say
!backtrack | fatpat
actionparsnip: so i just need to run the update manager and reboot?
Jesse: then its already part of you install.  updates help lots
actionparsnip: ok i will come back after updates have installed if i am unable to get it to work. thank you.
ty :)
yw
glad your around  .. heh
ty ;)
but the right click thing isnt working and i still cant see my icons.
How did you restart x? With Ctrl+Alt+Bksp?
it. it 's very slow
need more details. what is slow exactly
get new software package
during the upprade process or after installation
: during
well it is just a bit more than a day since initial release, so the servers are likely to be a bit slower.. err two days
, oh ,thank you .
you can change software sources in those settings
,the wire speed is not very stable.  which resource is quick?
go into system-->administration-->software sources and reset there if you wish.  the TW mirrors are always fast
oh like 8.10and 8.04
yes, they are always fast
,but it's updating now ,i can't change
from which mirrors
the default
keep in mind that the uk based security servers are generally much slower than ones closer to you
ok. whats some good fault settings for a 17ich lcd?. h sync 30-70, Vrefresh 50-160?
I'm lucky on that one  I just remove all that stuff..amd64 system automatically detects it
14 gameservers, 1 DNS+gateway+mail, 6 at work (SQL, LDAP, Web, Mail, DNS, CUPS) with hardware RAID, offsite backups every 2 hours) and 3 at home for various things *cough*, and now I'm installing the new server for the apartment complex.  yeah, I should probably learn more about it.  I never get the time to learn though... I'm so busy just keeping all the servers up and maintaining all the services
thats always the problem, vmware helps a lot though if you just want to play
I could talk to you about the gameservers and how they are connected to an SMS gateway (as in cellphone textmessages), keeping track of payments, activating gameservers and stopping them on time, rsync setups and so on. oh
dj-fu: we always do real time mirroring , i think i would get bitch slapped if we risked anything else :)
Idk its a brand new laptop
what is this idk ?
i need jre. azureus:. Depends: sun-j2sdk1.5 but it is not installable or. java2-runtime but it is not installable. where do i get j2sdk?
chinaman: sun's java is installable with the synaptic's "Multiverse" repositories
and how do i install it?. hmm
you need to find the "non free" repository. give me a min
uh...where wouldthat be. k
you're on breezy?
hoary
then I dont know if its the same....  give me a min, I need to find my "repository" list
sure
open your synaptic
opened
now go to configuration and then on repositories
yeah
then click on "Show desactivated software origins". usually the top version. the top choice I mean
yeah
did you activated them?
yeah, it's checked
ok then get out of there. and see if the repositories have been chosed (activated ). they should have a green thingie in the lil box of each repository
i can get the firefox app to use a CPU down to 38% but then when i play it back it spikes past system capacity.  there's nothing that big in there.  25k
-> look around there,
nothing
-> well if not there look somewhere in you ~/.mozilla or ~/firefox i fyou have this dir
sory-> bittornado
no idea, but it's gotta be in the settings somewhere
yeas. but I dont know the answer
are you running software center while installing in a terminal, for example?
mmm maybe!. let me check. nope. not that I can see
ok, it could be an automatic repo update. try again in a minute or two.
ok. and it its not working any way?. any sugestions?
if it still doesn't work, use pgrep and pkill to find the stray dpkg/apt process, and kill it.
Need to select wifi network at login screen
At a login screen?
getting Failed to add/activate connection (32) insufficient network privileges.  yes, lightdm
What does lightdm have to do with the network manager?
disregard, still a bit confused with terminology
Are you unable to login to your user account?
I don't have access to the routers port forwarding from here
no then unless your firewall is rubbish
i'll try.  update-grub is an unkown command
sudo update-grub should work
I have, it is a real pain!
pastebin your [URL]nf?
if I create a win8 usb installer, then use YUMI to add Ubuntu, it ALWAYS goes directly to win8, with secure boot on.  with UEFI that is
I believe this app will install in fedora, I use this for my usb iso loading, it has W8 and many linux iso's loaded.. [URL]  uefi is the computer setup the usb need just be a fat32 like usual.
yeah, I get that, I just don't know why it always goes to Windows 8 installer. The only way to get it into the YUMI grub menu is going back to legacy
been awhile since I used yumi, you confined to what OS for loading the ISO's?
only have windows 8 running at the moment
And you want to install ubuntu?
i want to write my own indicatir applet. what library do i have to use? (Python)
That's your choice! If you want terminal-based, GTK-based, etc..  You don't HAVE to use any, you just have to choose!
thanks... it'd be nice if canonical could just announce on their download page that they completely broke a particular version for use with vbox before people waste hours downloading, installing, configuring things, and then trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with guest additions
I would prefer it rain polkadots and moonbeams, either is about equal to happen. ;)
yeah, unfortunately... thanks again though
I would say though that if you were unaware of any downgrade info, I would doubt you've not made some user errors. Consider thought before making emotional statements.
Thanks
[URL]. me thinkgs. thinks*
Yeah, I was reading though the guide for manual install. I just wanted to check there wasn't an offical ubuntu package for it before I started downloading and building it myself.
building?
um, no it should eject properly...and I did use kill, did you even read what I typed? :)
it 'should' eject properly, but obviously nautilus wasnt finished with it
I need it to be executed as root
so use sudo/gksudo in the script
but then it will ask for the password?
what do you need ran exactly?.  not if you configure /etc/sudoers correctly
sudo nvclock -n 630 -m 610 -f.  of course, thanks
and that command does what  ?
ok, great. just custom partition, I assume. wanted to make sure heh
is there a systray icon for evolution? ;)
yes i was planning to to it by myself but i'd like to know if this already existed to not duplicate the work :)
I don't know if it is already existing, but I really doubt someone would go through the trouble.  pm me in a sec and I'll give you some source that may help you
any solution so far?
linux recovery cd
that sucks :(
I was kidding. sorry
i cant uninstall it
error messages?
ok, now it's /dev/sdc1 contains a mounted file system - by the way its not unmountable with gparted and disk utility
from terminal "mount | grep -i sdc"
'/dev/sdc1 on /media/y>' is shown
from terminal "sudo umount /media/y"
oh, yeah, I wasn't trying to say avidemux isn't good too
then there's cinepaint, also with a different foucs :).  'course Glasgow hasn't been developed much faster than GEGL has
it's super fiddly with all of this manual key generation...
dont need keys. just passwords
where du i get those?
Both are in Synaptic
ok so i jus download them?
Yeah, in Synaptic
@ syka, should i select avant-window-navigator-data or awn-applets-python-core?
avant-window-navigator ..  Not the -data
u mean da awn-applets-........ ?
No, avant-window-navigator. it's a package
but it has -data at the end
There is one without
oh so ishould select both?
yes
syka: hw much space dos ot take?
Not sure. Nearly none (probably 10-20mb)
syka: wat should i du nw?
Has it installed?
yes
well, run it
i cant find it in system. oh found it. is it awn-manager?. syka: is it calld awn-manager?
Yup
syka: wat do i do den?
Not sure. There should be instructions
syka: general, task appearnace, bar appearanc, glass engine and pattern engine toolbars appear
Those are the options C:
so i just mess around wid dem?. syka: which one is 2 hav da icons at da bottom?
Applets on the left side
What do i have to do?
wait untiil your updatemanager tells you need to do updates
its can cause some very bad problems at timnes.. so i advise getting away from spaces :)
oktanouc, thanks :). thanks*
I actually used the git reset --hard
and the file wasn't commited yet?
it was. But I also force pushed it.. So it isn't online anymore. nor it's anywhere on my pc.
on github? it might still be there if you remember the commit hash
hellbouded: thanks, how?
I sent you a PM. so this way what I'm saying doesn't get whiped off the screen
what's an uplink?
connections to the internet
can janusvm run java programs through tor?
tor is one network you don't want to connect with
why is that?
less then 1% is legal and every security service is connected
what do you mean every security service is connected?
and as long you don't have multiple uplinks connected to true different networks and internet exchanges then it's fake security
what security services are connected
every secret service has multiple nodes running in the tor network
most nodes are in central and northern europe.  but i dont know much about this, do you know WHICH security services are connected?.  how about freenet?
I'm not going to answer for more than one reason
what reasons?
there are enough papers on why networks like tor don't work in the Internet we now live in
what about things like freenet, I2P and GNUnet
when you have at least three connections and change them every four to six months maybe, but then other people start to ask questions
do you care to elaborate in private?
no I'm bound to certain rules, but search for electronic blow whistle and there are enough pdf's that will explain the situation to start with.  and now back to on-topic again
seaphor i dont know. seaphor yes i fo. do. seaphor what should i do? disable the other startup programs?
need to know that in the question you ask here, need to know more details, thats why no one is answering you
what details do you need?.  what details do you need?
i dont know the answer, just trying to help you get your question answered
what details should i provide?
all.  in one msg
i dont know what more i can provide
what "startup programs " were you talking about?
i not talking about any startup programs
<> seaphor what should i do? disable the other startup programs?
oh yes that would be deluge
like i said, i dont know the answer, i'm just trying to help you state your question to get the help you need
urgh.. a whole mysql server instance for replace :(. thanks
no poblem
Both... laptop needs to migrate from network to network... (I saw another option in synaptic recently... can't locate it now)
I use kwlan for my wireless and guessnet/ifplugd/resolvconf for my lan.  oh you are on gnome?
yes
I also tried network-manager but I hate using dhcp all the time so I chose guessnet for lan
no.  my system has 2gb, I remember gvfsd using 1.7 gb (since my comp was acting slow, I decided to check)
your system may has 2 GB installed, but your GPU (Nvidia maybe, maybe close to a 7000M?) has some of that ram dedicated to it, so your operating system only has ~1.7GB available
right, but that doesn't explain why gvfsd is using 1.7gb of memory
are you using rhythmbox?
But if I run 2 GUIs at the same time, won't the programs running in those GUIs interfere with the programs in the other GUI?. I mean some programs lock files
depends on the program.
What would be an applicatoin to run 2 GUIs?
if ran by differnt users. no issues.. ran by the same issue - couldbe.. you run whatever winow manager, or desktop you want on the second x session.
Just trying to think of a scenario where it would make sens to start another display via startx -- :1
testing out a 2nd window manager, or desktop on a 2nd monitor. Multi seat setups. running xbmc on a 2nd monitor..
It is a program. HandBrake.
you usually run programs with "./name_of_binary" from a console... double-clicking on it on X
Ah, good.. Unfortunatley, when I try to fix it with applications:///, it just won't "take".
killall gnome-panel
i dont know... inst a cd that install it on linux. i cant remember where i found it
for the Quake 3 thing to work you need the windows game. for the Quake 3 data
I know, it's very lulzworthy :( I friggin' hate ATI :(
yeah, the sad thing is it actually has gotten better lol. It still sucks though. What are you trying to do?
thanks, that worked
2d will work with VIA, do not expect hw accelerated video and transparancy stuff
thanks. No rules. What could be stopping these things opening a port?
they may be trying privileged ports, in which case try starting them with sudo
Yeah. Your file system has errors. Have you run an fsck from a boot disk?
I think that's just because it's mounted.  the point is, it's very fragmented
" Yeah. Your file system has errors. Have you run an fsck from a boot disk?"
I run an fsck every 30 boots to fix things. I don't generally boot from boot disks, no
I would do that.
do you think that might help my problem? I can see it will fix the unrelated problem of having a few inconsistencies on the disk, but will it help with the fragmentation?
The other issue could be a dying hard drive.
dying hard drives can cause high fragmentation?
You won't have defrag issues. It's the file system that is corrupt.
the file system is inconsistent AND 30% of the files are fragmented
I can see it with iwconfig. It shows up as ra0. I just can't see it in NetworkManager and it won't scan
can u try doing iwlist ra0 scanning ?. right click on ur networkmanager icon and see if wireless is checked
iwlist ra0 scanning returns: ra0 No scan results.  wireless is indeed checked
thats not a good sign.. dont u have an ap in range?. ap = access point
ok i'll have a look.  everything seems to be at full volume
are there any MMs?
MM, there is no bar above MM.  MM says IEC958 under it
MM = muted.... also check all the way to the right... there might be more options than the terminal shows
no thats it
well you could also try kmix which is my preferred GUI audio app
is kmix for kde?.  I'm in gnome
gnome alsa mixer?
well it does opens .. but after 30 secons .. it close it self
and then post it here so we can see too.  try running "netbeans > log" from a terminal (without the ")
ok
wait until it closes and and look at the log file it created in your home dir
The program 'netbeans' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:. how do you launch it?
you will have to get the name of the executable. copy the menu entry to your desktop and look at the properties of the link
ok.  look [URL]
, the java vm states an out of memory exception. have you upgraded from a previous release or done a fresh install
I just upgrade ubuntu from 10.04 to 10.10
ok I would suggest you backup your work and try reinstalling netbeans by doing "sudo apt-get purge netbeans && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get install netbeans" be careful, this will most likely remove your netbeans settings. do a backup
Thanky0ou. you*
You're welcome
I can't see any "system info" option? (11.04)
hmm. 11.04 i'm not sure. what interface?
gnome
one moment
i am newbie with setting up dns. name server. ERGH no one here to help me
I said wassup..  what is your issue with DNS?
it doesn't exist on my machine either. that's the problem..  i want to know what i should install in order to get that command
what are you trying to do?
because a tutorial on writing gnome-panel applets requires it
ahh. prob. a -dev package
I set up PulseAudio, but it doesn't help. Oddly enough holding down Alt-Tab to switch between windows constantly makes the sound stop skipping while the system is switching between windows
I'm not an expert at any of this, that's just what I did. Did look for "perfect pulseaudio setup" and follow all the instructions in there?. grrr. the new flash10 beta doesn't install on x64
I'm trying to understand how to change permissions on a mounted volume (hdc1) so that it is accessible to anyone logged in, not just "root."
Where is it mounted?
how would i change it.  prefernces>network proxy is set to connect direct to internet
VCD's - old skool :)
Ye, so I don't understand why grub is here. Grub was not in the MS usb loader
For a boot, why does it matter?
It takes forever to install
grub just kicks to the install, has nothing to do with install time.
it said installing. then it said done, then it said installing grub. So it has been in this mode for more than 20 minutes
Not sure how this is related, but go ahead..  Installing when, what is the context?
Been like this for ages: http://i.snag.gy/[URL]g bar is going left to right, wonder to kill it and start over
It is really hard to tell what the context are in your inquiry, for example installing winusb, and loading the usb, or installing on the HD. I believe your calling the loading of the ISO as the install..  That is a pirate iso not supported here.
cant get flash to work either
flash won't work with Ubuntu's 64-bit install. unless you get into chroots etc
cute ;) but how do I do that?
have you done an apt-get update, upgrade lately?
yup. last night.
and what is the current version of alsa-lib?
I don't even know how to check that :-/
dpkg -l | grep -i alsa
I don't think they are. They killed unity.
ive seen unity get confused when the drivers are working. ;()
I'm not sure if that's it.
hrmm. True, you can only add stuff to localhost
proxy isn't what I'm looking for really.
don't know then :)
I mean, did I break something? All I wanted to do was change the CLI screen resolution..
what did you edit?
/etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/00_header
what did you add/edit?
<unconvertable>  I installed the wrong version of ubuntu-tweak and need to remove it ... but I get that error in Synaptic when i try to uninstall it
I'm not sure what to do; just try to install the correct version; think it might just overwrite the existing one.
<unconvertable>  nope ... it says that there is a more recent version already installed
that's most certainly a bug what just happened to you i think..  go to terminal and try "sudo apt-get install --no-recommends <the_correct_version>". Might work; else someone else might help out cos i don't know what to do:).
no. so does that mean i gotta download it again?!
general_error: searches.... general_error: I believe so...64 bit kernels cannot be found in repos.... devlin: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should do it ;)
damn ok
general: you could ask in -devel tho, perphaps they know somethin' that I don't ;)
e.g is there any strategy/RPG game without wrath and war and relate to brain ? an non-online ?
its a pokemon game so no one dies, they just faint
stockbrian: I believe so yes. stockbrian: how do I find out?
are they both USB?
stockbrian: yes
I've seen generic Dell K/M's load up fine on many versions of Linux. Forgive the silly question but you've done all the silly troubleshooting like swapping USB ports and stuff?
stockbrian: I just don't want to have to buy logiteck or microsoft. stockbrian: yes. stockbrian: in the boot sequence the errors strart popping up after ''loading blue tooth''
I'm not sure that's related.
I can't find an option in the man-page :-/
*
they still work :D
if they exist.
12.04 LTS, when i drag something using the touchpad, it releases as soon as i let go of the touchpad. i want it to continue dragging until i tap again. it's just a free time curiosity project.

dunno whats missing/wrong :)
:(
grub-probe is there, i installed the grub2 from the package manager.  it gave some error saying can't configure
what error did it give you??
don't remember now. when I try aptitude install grub-pc, now, it gives this error. [URL]  don't remember now. when I try aptitude install grub-pc, now, it gives this error [URL]
try apt-get remove --purge grub2. then reinstall
unsure what that is
did you ever edit your /etc/[URL]nf file?
xmms won't do nothing, kaffeine and amarok spin it but make no sound.  tha'ts a good question but I know it works in Windows
There's a difference between it reading the disc digitally and sending it through your computer to your sound card so to speak, and it reading it analogue and sending the sound directly to your sound card..  You might find an option in xmms to change which method it uses. Gimme a sec and I'll install xmms and check if there's such an option.
everything seems to be connected
There was a cable from your cd-rom directly to your sound card?
no there's an ide cable, a power cable and some skinny cable that goes to the mobo
the skinny cable is probably the sound cable. Is your sound cable to your speakers connected to a pci sound card or to a port in the motherboard?
I believe it goes to a pci soundcard
Which is the same card your speakers are connected to?
yes
Okay, fire up xmms please, go into options and find the audio plugins.  Audio I/O plugins to be precise.
I don't see it under the "Options" menu
Sorry.. Options->preferences
ok gotcha
now doubleclick CD Audio Player under Audio I/O plugins
CD Audio Player 1.2.10. and configure?
Yep, double click or configure.  In there you can click Check Drive.  It'll probably say something about a non-existant drive..  Correct?
ok ....  this is the ouput: 05:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g [14e4:4315] (rev 01). output*
what computer type,make,model are you running this on ?
it is a Lenovo S10 netbook
are you currently having b43 running ?
:D.  thanks :D noticed that one :)
got it?
yuh thanks :D
Shinjan: lazy tab completion. oops again
hahaha! :D
your nick completes to that unless I type the whole thing :)
haha
the irony is, I then noticed i had an onboard sound device :p. yes, its possible
yep
he is using the 12.04
yes its [URL] and its the GRUB_DEFAULT setting you will need to change
I appreciate the link. I'm horrid with this command thingy.. I'm assuming there is no GUI for booting straight to 11.10
yeah, was encouraged to try dapper - which i dont really want to do
oh, sounds like its not fixed then. If they ask you to install Dapper then its probably fixed there - and will take to much effort (just guessing though) to backport to ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy). So if you dont want to try dapper - which i understand, i guess you will have to wait for Dapper...  to check if a bug is fixed - browse the buzille. The bugs will be marked as fixed when they are.. i think
so how does everyone else cope with unmounting their ipods? i cant be the only one with an ipod? :)
I dont have one so I dont know. There are diffrent versions of the Ipod (generations.) which probably behaves a bit diffrent. You can try to google about it. It should not be a problem. (If you know your way in the terminal you should be able to force an umount..)
farsworth_: will that allow me to keep the other stuff I have open?
sec.  alt+ctrl+2 switches to a console and alt+ctrl+7 switches back
right now I am running lubuntu on it. but i'm about to put in the 2 new ssds
so what's the existing disk and what's the plane for that? no Windows at all right now?
yeah the existing disk is just 5400 rpm 240GB disk that i'm not going ot use anymore because the laptop can only fit 2 in it as is.
hmm, Windows on the 240GB and ubuntu on the 120GB then
same setup works on one server, but does not work on the other one.... @ this is a server with an ISP, don't have access to the router. I did use nmap however. running it locally
does your isp allow you to run it remotely?
@ this is the full picture [URL] @ you mean run nmap remotely?
yes
slart: thanks =)
but of course you've already read that in man man ;)
yes
i think if you right click on a folder, and select to share it. it'll ask you if you want to share it on the windows network. and that should do it. although you'll need username/password to access the share from other computers
i see, thanks.
!12.04
have you heard of Mir ?
yes
thank u
have fun / be safe
i have no idea what that means, I just want to learn how to turn my computer into a tivo like device so I figured the place to start is figure out how to stream a hdtv signal to it.  DVB i'm assuming is the 5-6 pin coax connection right?
you need a hd tuner card, DVB-S2 for satellite
Unsuitable: It returns 10400 entries.
w8 i'll look for it.  the shortcut for firefox to your "Home" page is "Alt+Home"
This translates on my computers to Alt+Fn+Pos1. -- Thank you very much.
ok
is that for all format. ?
yes, it's a command line downloader, but there's a GUI representation of wget too
i need the graphical
download gwget
yeah i download it it is front end of wget. how can i use it for example i have youtube vidioe and how can i download it
use youtube-dl for youtube vids, also command line.  and there's a youtube-dl-gui for GUI in python
id ownload it both of them but the youtube-dl how can i use it?
gwget and youtube-dl-gui?
what is the command line to get the newest nvidia drivers
I told you already
just that ?
yes
ok, then how do i get the desktop to come back up from a black screen ... with just a cursor
provide more context
i come to a logon window that is white ... no text ... then when i login .. the desktop becomes black and a cursor appears ... and thats it
did it ever work?
can you please tell me the instructions. thanks
after the first step and before the second do, sudo apt-get update
I want to enable it, it won't let me proceed
there are two choices, choose the right one ("disable minimize effect")
sigh, I want to enable it tho...
no, you don't..  'Minimize' is a separate plugin which you don't need if you enable Animations
I have tethered conncetion through my phone now, but Ubuntu can't find any restricted drivers
if you can, connect through ethernet. simple.
any ideas?. yes. it says to do make as user. make install as root
hmm...really not sure, that's weird
huh?
the app store is available as off 9.10
yeah. So what does that mean?
means join #ubuntu+1 support for 9.10 is there
if you still have the .bin file lying around
well. yes
ok, install the package: java-package. (if it gives an error: enable mulitverse)
syntapic ?
yes synaptic. or apt-get :)
I need to add your server :o?
I did, but when I do a "iwlist scan" I can see other routers with their setting "Encryption: on", but mine continues to say "off"
weird
tell me about it, I've been working on this for days; when I turn WEP off, it still says encryption off, but I can connect now, but I don't want to leave WEP off, you know?
yeah... i always keep mine open so i'm not too clear on WEP issues
Is that a temp. operation? And what should I type in my console ?
if you run it from the cli, yes. You can edit your ~/.bashrc to make it permanent.
oh sorry... i mean Firefox
you should just need to visit a page that requires flash and click on "install" on the yellow bar that pops up
i clicked on install missing plugins and installed the adobe plugin, but i still can't view flash.. youtube for example
ah, when did you do this?
don't think so (will try soon). Num lock does not respond, so I guess not
but it's not hardware related, right?
ctrl+alt+f1 does not work. It's not hardware related but becomes a problem when ubuntu has booted up
maybe some module is missing for some very strange reason. i would investigate it via chroot environment from live. maybe i would put openssh server on that instance to get access through network after it boots up and would try to bring some logs here, lspci, lsusb, dmesg, syslog, lsmod, boot log
alright, will try. I'm trying "ubuntu with advanced option" from the boot up menu now. will try recovery mode
[URL] also. brb
what am I supposed to do?
after getting into chroot environment you will be able to work into that instance with modules and /dev/ from the original environment, so if you keyboard works in live it will work on the "dead" instance. you will be able to execute commands under that "dead" instance in many cases, installing additional software, edit configs and things responsible for boot process
OK. So you are telling me the ufw firewall is on by default anyway?
I don't know.
it worked until the reboot
screwed up fstab. skip the part about creating. and focus on fstab
vgchange -a y activated it
sweet. I know nothing about it :P.  so everything works? :P
how to execute scripts at startup?.  yes now it works again but only manually
ravn: qrite up a quoick bash script andadd it to init.d
where is init.d?
uhm /etc/init.d. it has start up scripts. or you could add it to rc.local
I would appreciate if anyone could help me out a bit.. red-lichtiel: what do you mean?. red-lichtiel: Motherboard or sound card board?. It is a CA0106. thats the driver name. that's being used on my System
I assume you've disabled the MoBo sound, so what creative board
I can hear static when i cycle through the options in the Volume Control. Yes i have disabled the on-board sound. Sound Blaster Audigy SE card
Have you reduced the mic inout to 0 ?. s/inout/input/
why?. Looks liek the patch was submitted to the lkml in 2.6.6
because not everyone has the same hardware
hmmm, something must be wrong then. like it has already replaced some of the theme stuff, some of the task bars in windows, but not everything
open emerald-theme-manager.  make sure the theme is actually in there.  also open ccsm and click on the window decoaration plugin to get into it's settings and in the"Command" field replace what is there with emerald --replace.  ah emerald will ONLY decorate the window title bar.  well the entire window frame anyway.  emerald is strictly only a window decroator it will not theme the gnome panel..or the menu or window interior colours
php5. I'm so used to BSD I tend to get lost sometimes with the ubuntu packages & such..
extension for use with what?
extensions to use with php5. I want to install a bunch of extensions, but I don't want to install them all manually. I would prefer to install them from a config selection list or something and install that way.
what extensions.  php is an application/scripting lanaugage
ming, iconv, mbstring, etc
they look like functions within php
I never said I was putting it on an eeepc. I built the computer myself and just have no need to buy a DVD drive at this point
ok  sorry i got crossed up with another line in chat
I've tried that, but it doesn't detect the printer and I can't select USB as the port
brother are a pain (like lexmark) look in synaptic for any brother drivers and google your model
is synaptic installed in a fresh install or is it something I have to download on the side?
its installed by default
where would I find this program? through the terminal ?
System > Administration > Synaptic
ubuntu and yes, gnome
under system > preferences > preferred apps make sure you have a default browser set
I believe so, because the log does not show a disconnect regarding the xpad drivers
when you remove it, try a: sudo rmmod xpad
iris noone is dere to chat
what problem are you facing?
hmm how do i get there ?
not sure, google i guess :)
I'm putting a lock on FD 200 but I want to check if another process already locks 200 and if so I want to WAIT but ALSO echo something
again, fd (esp. the #) is specific to a process, it's not about if they have that fd locked, but if they have the underlying file locked.
are you suggesting the onboard card is ATI?. either way, yes i've tried using vesa drivers for both the cards
I just read it wrong, thaught for a second that matrox = radeon.
hehe
Have you tried using just the matrox card?
That takes me to the login screen
kill gdm
Dominicdinada: install disc is 8gb usb key, target drive is 1tb sata.. Never mind, it just finished
well 1TB is alot of drive space... guess you shouldnt have chose to secure wipe it
All set, it's rebooting
In the future just realize it used to take house to format a 1 gig hd.... Blah wow transfering 120gigs over the network is taking forever :(
i'll try it tnx.  Ivalid operation....  I don
??
I don't have it in the packages also, and have no internet connection with that computer
then you will have todl them from other computer search for it on [URL] the package is linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-generic 8if you use gutsy)
hwlide_, I'm fine with only getting what will be outputted next, isnt there a way to catch it with a console?
find where it is started.
how?
goto terminal and type locate whatever its called
yep, its still asking me for the password
you did really follow every step and also read the other postings from the other people in that thread?
is there anyway you can verify to see if i did it right?
nope ... but my guess is that you activated auto-login in GDM? :-)
GDM? probably not, is that my problem?
does your system ask you for username and passwd before it lets you access your desktop?
nope.  can i send you the text from the gdm /etc/pam.d file?
so you have enabled auto-login in GDM, e.g. you turn on your machine and wooosh you find yourself on your GNOME desktop?
yes
so you did not read the guide then :-)
im sending you a PM with the file info
this part is specifically mentioned in that guide ;-)
trying  :{ i cant find it, is it possible to eject a live cd to burn xp?
you could use a live cd to burn a new XP cd, yes
cant seem to get it to eject
eject?. oh
only 1 dvd drive
I see.  what if you ran the live CD from USB? You could also probably run ubuntu's filesystem checker on your NTFS partition if that's the only utitlity you are looking for.  well it's another program, but [URL]
I know how to ssh but how to use that for every port? how to setup this environment?
you'd use the tunnel as a local proxy.
in the bittorent client application? like ktorrent utorrent etc?
sure, why not.....  obviously, you will need to ssh to somewhere where torrents awork
are there any free such services?
you'd have to look online. It's how I get round stupid proxies at work :-)
what's the line to install it hyper ?
hmm im not sure maybe you need the 64 bit for 64bit xeon though
hmpfh. the regular is ?
let me see
@slart, everytime i set it to autostart it's always on top
you've changed the config file?
yes. let me check the specifics
I think there was something about window class widget.. never had to mess with that.. it just worked
I added it and the behavior didn't change
testdisk is a data recovery app so isn't useful. Got muddled
hdparm already install. iostat shows the data well enough
you can set options on devices with hdparm
okay. /home//usr/bin/magic/starer.jar. and my magic.sh --> /home//usr/bin/magic.sh
right
i downloaded the latest eclipse version because i think the one in the repository is obsolete. the java ide
ok let me check
eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-linux-gtk.tar.gz
ok I am here [URL]
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (85 MB). that one
32 or 64 bit
32
ok its downloading hold on
well i was trying to follow the instruction from a website but got stuck in one of the steps.  already extracted the file
ok which website?
[URL]  the more "INSTALL" or "README" part
which part did you get stuck on?
it is capitalized
well this is a java application and s hould be started with sun java web start most likely.  but hold on
well the readme or install part i only got a readme folder.  instead of the file
ok let me get this download and check ")
okey
its only half downloaded slow for some reason
well i don't know i downloaded it today because the old eclipse went haywire today
two minutes left
:CP
ok lets see what we have here hold on
i have 10.10 right now
ok System > Administration > hardware drivers
alright. running 14.04 + Win7. was building something from source, required libncurses. didn't work, so i gave up, tried to uninstall libncurses, removed wrong package, pressed enter like an idiot, and apt-get removed everything. now ubuntu doesn't even show up in grub...
not gonna ask "how" but ... WOW!
yah... i think it must've been a library that everything was dependent on. guess there wasn't a fail safe against that.... so, is there any way to salvage my install or should i just grab my files and do a fresh install?
cure: boot an ubuntu USB. ( You DO keep one or 2 of those handy, right?) reinstall grub. if that fails, chroot to your ubuntu and then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop that'll get you back to your default desktop.. !grub
im trying to get the drivers working... i think
why are you 'installing' drivers for it?
because the drivers just stopped working and seemed to have completely disappeared of their own accord
im sure, did you use alsamixer to adjust your audio ?
no audio device
so you have no audio device listed in lspci ? (please do NOT post any output from lspci in the channel --- that is more than one line)
actually my sound card is listed in lspci
ok, and when you open alsamixer, it gives an error?
yes
ok, so did you do something to 'remove' the driver for the audio card?
worried, that i wont be able to play anymore <:. my research so far: 11.04 will feature x-server 1.9 for which a working nvidia-96 should exist - is that correct?
i don't know specifics, but if it worked for 9.10 - you should be able to make it work with 10.10 or 11.04 for that matter. maybe will need some tweaking.
i searched at launchpad project and didn't find. all i find is it db of answers. :(
[URL]
Hmm ok - what I'm ultimately trying to do is change the contents of /proc/release -- is this even possible?
/proc/release doesn't exist anymore.  maybe you meant something else (this is on 16.10)
Sorry I meant /proc/version
why do you want to change that file?
Aha - this will sound stupid, but im doing a CTF competition that involves a binary that check the value of /proc/release for a certain value. So I want to change THAT value
have you verified in the source that /proc/version depends on the sysctl values
Would you expand VT for me?
Virtual Terminal, aka TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F1-6)
The scroll lock key doesn't work when I'm in X. Are you suggesting I should switch to a VT and try it?
I didn't think it did anything in X
It doesn't. That's the problem.
what do you expect it to do?
ogout.  Well, I've got a KVM switch that expects me to press scroll lock twice to switch between machines..  But whenever I'm in X, scroll lock seems to be disabled.
well, how could anything be intercepting that?
sadly, the bug has been open since 2001.  there's a working patch but i don't know why it's never been comitted
I can see it even when typing in xchat here. Words such as I've, couldn't, etc. Interestingly, haven't shows up fine since haven is a legitimate word.
it's sad that such an obvious and easybug has went uncorrected for 7 years
yep, but I can understand why. It is slightly annoying, but doesn't really stand in the way of usability. It says something that I haven't bothered to look into it myself in this time.
receive and send emails over smtp / pop3 / imap. I installed dovecot and postfix
postfix, perfectly documented
yep, there is, in all partitions :|. *there are
the trashcan is a per user thing
oh ya, I know :P I was talking about .Trash-1000 directories of other partitions that normally appears in my Trashcan. My ~/local/Trash/files have one file, and other partitions .Trash-1000 directories have many other files/dirs
then you know more than I do -- never heard of them
I'm already rebooted my system, but it still showing nothing in the Trash :|. *I
anyway the trash folder on the desktop only shows the one in your homedir
if not (and I wonder why not),  then what are the options to interact remotely with the usb device?
filesharing protocols do not have such options.
tnanx a lot...what should i do to let them work? i installed vidalia and tor...but im not sure bout their configuration....
Usually, there are two parts. 1) Start Vidalia. 2) Configure the applications you want to "anonymize" (Firefox for example)
vidalia onion is green, i have torbutton for firefox too but when i turn it on no page will open.  i'd like to anonymize firefox
Does it say "Timed out" or "Connection refused" or something else?
firefox now says e to add an exception.  tell me if my english is not clear...im italian =)
What address you're trying to open?
google...but the problem is with every site...my router one too
All sites ask to add an exception?
yes
Even non-SSL ones? (without https://)
may u give me an exemple?
[URL]  That one really should _not_ ask for an exception :/
if i try to open the link u gave me it says me to add an exception =(.  may we control torbutton and vidalia parameters or something else?
Hmm, check your proxy settings -- they should look like this [URL] -- except for the SOCKS port!
now if i try to open last link u gave me firefox says me connection refused by proxy server
Ah, hmm. Then: Manual configuration, HTTP/SSL/FTP/Gopher proxy EMPTY.
not that ~ in your whois
thats your host name
it says ~@hostname
what do you want hten?
no i dont indygunfreak
well, that doesn't make any sense. regardless, whats checked on the first tab
Thanks Yaro I will look into that
Try going into Synaptic and look for libpng-dev or something tlike the same..  You're welcome.
i hate installing libs because there is always like several versions available. i ususally just get the one that looks like its the latest
That's normally good practice.
its saying that libpng-12-dev is a vertual package. that means I already have it installed basically correct?
Not sure. Is the little box next to it filled in green?
I am using apt not synaptic. but I would assume that means there is a package installed fulfilling that link
Okay, so just an easy way to see if its installed is to just sudo apt-get install libpng1.2-dev and see if it says anything about it "already being the latest version."
thats what I did. and it said 'this is a virtual package that referes to some other package. i assume the other package is installed
What was the package.
orly?
edit /boot/grub/menu.lst , the boot options are at the bottom of the file, you just cut and paste them to different positions. if you have any that you don't want you can comment them out aswell with a #
thank you mate, will try it :)
make a copy of the file in case anything goes wrong
lol yeah i learned that much already :p
hehe okay:)
ubuntu 17-10
then you should not have asked in #debian
i also asked in #gnome as well? isnt ubuntu a debain derivative and also nmcli is a gnome tool right, what is wrong with this behavour?
ubuntu is a debian derivative, but they're not the same (actually pretty different nowadays). if you're looking for help with your distribution you should ask in your distro's support channel (only).
ok thanks for the clarity.  do you also get the same error? do you know how to fix the error
i would not know, can't help there.
tx boy
long time since anyone called me a boy :). vive la Suisse!,  ;)
salut tu es d'ou?

yes, theres a folder there named backup, its being copied
sounds like you dont have permission to open that folder
No :(
I would guess that Evolution has a backup dir for such things...I just have no idea where it is.
Hehe I was hoping so too;)
Somewhere in /usr/ perhaps?
pls  dont get what is synaptics
GUI for apt-get
is there any fix on gnome 3?
sry, dont know
on unity, can u explain me how exactly should i be doing that. press alt key and then resize it, is that the way?
press alt and grab the titlebar from that window and push it beyond the screen
can I not have a dead zone plz
use same rez on both i guess. Never had an issue with it myself
you mean the same widthXheight?
only fix i can think of. I dont recall it being a problem with twinview/nvidia
damn
i never span somthing across both moitors. So never even notice it
- I've done that, nothing happends.  - it selects the program, but the radiobox remains unchecked
when clicking on the bullet? When I click on the name nothing happens either, but when I click the bullet it gets selected...
System will use any space available on the fc created on usb?. fs
on the whole file system actually. If you have a swap partition on your hard drive it will be used
What in cases where linux is installed on usb?
as I said, if there is no swap partition available, it won't use any swap
oh, okay. will it set it as the default then?
then you choose the program from the list, or if it isn't in the list, type in the name in the bottom. there should be a checkbox for "always use this type" or something at the bottom
oh, okay. thanks a ton
welcome
how do you mean?
if you have the xserver-xgl package installed, you won't have direct rendering
it's not installed
what video card?
NV140
what does this command return?: xvinfo | grep Xgl
no output
pastebin the output of: LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo
[URL]
I guess some permissions are wrong, but I'm not entirely sure :/
what makes you suspect perms?
because that's usually what would make direct rendering fail for no apparent reason
still listed as root root after chgrp
tyle_d: try sudo chgrp
its on an ftp folder, want it to be set to nogroup
btw,  it's sudo chgrp groupname filename. so then have it be sudo chgrp nobody filename
how I reach that menu
"alternate cd" [URL]
thank you :-)
of course, you can always try another window manager. i just kind of dealt with it on gnome/compiz
I cant get audio out of hdmi any ideas?
Of course, if you need help with ALSA, you can ask in #alsa and so on.
done that. still cant play mp3
That should allow it. What player are you using?
Pic amarok
Ah. You may need kubuntu-restricted-extras as well then.
. I have to pm
ok i guess
hmmm... is that on the default mirrors? I just made apt update it's repo files, and it's not finding that package
just a minute
Yes its fully updated to the latest version of 11.04
ok can you run: sudo lshw -C network; lsb_release -a; sudo rfkill list use [URL] to host the text. Chris3: as long as the files are healthy, you will be ok
I run all those things at the same time?
yes, its a single command
Should it be taking a minute.  Nvm its done
the lshw will take a while
Lol just realised, I cant pastie it with no internet
is the system a laptop?
Yes.  A netbook
then take a walk and use a wired connection
Its a netbook that doesnt have an ethernet port
I bet you it does, what model is it?
Dell Inspiron Duo... it does not have an ethernet port
can you give the full model?
- no where I would put it on my laptop... I'm kinda used to windows/putty. where you have a file stored locally. and then something on the server-side as well.. Wondering if it's the same on ubuntu
the ssh client looks at ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default. But you can configure more with ~/.ssh/config
Okay. thanks :D
on the server you put it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
no, it seems it only works w/ aplay, i cant get pulse audio to set it to the right hdmi :(
*nothing* using pulse has used it?
Nope
still, i think its likely you have routing issues
aplay -D plughw:0,3 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav works
i would double double check in pavulcontrol
i set it to all the different hdmi options in pavulcontrol and no audio
i would also look in alsamixer ... i generally trust *no* labels .  right.. but, it *is* working... you could try some alsa only live distro and see, but i think its just some simple fiddly routing issue
tsl/ssl. see im tryin to connect to a server. but they telling me i need to do it. with a ssl client
that's pretty vague, that are a lot of clients that use ssl, are you talking email? ssh? ssl just a protocol
ok will send you this. look. server: [URL]. port: 6697. chatroom: #tails. use TLS/SSL to connect!
if it's multilined, use pastebin.  ah, irc client with ssl support
Is that in any of the main repos for Drake?
wrong channel, see topic
does it tie itself to anything important
as far as i know, no
well, that sucks. lol
the point of show desktop is to minimize everything
ahum
seriously, dapper is reasonably stable now..  but not considered production quality.
im using dapper.. but just until recently.  when is it a good time to start using the unstable.  around flight 3?
that's impossible to answer. It's a matter of taste, and it depends on how good you are at troubleshooting.
within 3 years.
what does lspci say about it?
It worked a few days ago..  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV43 [GeForce 6200] (rev a2)
what about "glxinfo | grep -i corporation"
Thanks! In this case, do you think I should just wait for 14.04.1?
yes. if you use a LTS you want 14.04 to settle first
Gotcha. Thanks!
!hashes
x264, from git
check its documentation
and what does fprofiled in general mean?
I have no idea
how?
read the fine material
it won't mount, says crap about the existing filesystem...
Itk05: it's called the terminal.
can i just hose the whole thing and format it with a fat32 filesystem?
I have an old USB key that won't mount at all, no errors or anything, it just ignores it. So... I really don't know where to go from there.
I mean some fstab editing GUI tool for newbies.
just a text editor

'sudo fdisk -l'
:P. should have tried that already
Does it say "permission denied". ?

Really? sda is only 2G?
it might be my usb.  /dev/loop0 and /dev/sda are partitions from my usb
What type of computer is it? And what size and type of hard drive does it have in it?.  (What size is it *supposed* to be?)
got to lubuntu. Let us see if anyone there would help. By the way the mplayer for lubuntu is suddenly like the movie is moving in slow motion thought the sound is fine. any suggestions? I tried to increase the buffer for each

my sys goes slow [it look like it need swap] and not response.  i'm closed the firefox because the sys goes very slow after i cloesd the firefox it get normal again
hmm, try using something else
Where does setxkbmap look? I successfully changed it to the built-in de (with "setxkbmap de"), but when I want to change it to a custom layout, how do I do that? (it's already selectable in the "Keyboard Preferences", e.g. it has an entry in evdev.xml)
if you need to change the layout to something really custom, you can try xmodmap tool (man xmodmap for details), but if you need just different variant of de (like dvorak) issue setxkbmap de -variant dvorak . In both cases consult man setxkbmap first :)
I customized the "de" keymap (i.e. I created a new file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ and added it to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml ). I just need to know how I can select it with setxkbmap.
my knowledge is not so far
Ok, still, thanks .
np
in easy rsa folder of openvpn there are configs for openssl
???
I just stuck a CD in my drive
ah. Is there not a cd icon on your desktop?
yes
click on it.
it opens it in sound juicer... but it is a media/data CD and I want the data.  I thought it would mount on media/cdrom but nothing is there
ah. Try right-lciking, see if there are any options. Otherwise, load up the file manager and navigate to /media/cdrom0
no options other than the cd juicer, and there is nothing in cdrom0 or cdrom... which doesn't seem possible because I have already taken the music from it just now successfully.
not sure then, sorry :/
upgrade.
oh god I think that's a new record :D
Because I have so many things already installed/configured.
yeah, sure
s/Ancient Armadillo/Ubuntu Circa 4 years ago.
So what are those programs you're using? rendering...?
i can run 'em, but i wouldn't mind putting it on my iPod, which, unfortunately, has very little support for anything other than mp3. and rockbox is still a little unstable
tryed just renaming the file to .mp3?
nope, just linux
ext2 or ext3 then
ok thx
apache-modconf apache enable mod_php4.  should work.
md5
md5 isn't an authentaction method
I'm pretty sure Cisco devices use MD5 as the authentication method...
that's an encyption cipher, not an authentication method
ok, w/e... I'm just trying to set up authenticated NTP between my ubuntu server and my cisco lab
it's not "what ever" you need to know the authentication method.  it's pretty important, as then you can tell / setup the authentication client
@ they are muted. but it still makes that sound. whenever it goes to sleep or returns from sleep
Hm, okay, I guess that doesn't qualify as "system" then for whatever reason... I never got such a sound on Xubuntu though so it's kinda odd
well, some distro's let you upgrade the system without updating the kernel
oh I see what you mean  - Well you always have the choice of picking what packages you upgrade with synaptic but there may be dependcies ( which it will pick up )
thanks - I tried that but wondered whether there was more detail available - hence query
About the drivers or about your card?
yes. something like root@(none)~#: or something like it....  root@(none):~#
at that prompt, run 'fsck' with your root fs partition (something like /dev/hda1) and answer 'y' to everything
even Y to abort?
at least, every time it asks if you want to fix something
ok but last I remember from the 50+ times I never realy got asked to fix anything :(. I'll try your method
when it runs automatically it is run with -a, which tells it to fix everything automatically
Thaks, but I already tried that
then your probably missing the binary
I have u/usr/lib/eclipse and a host of other things
look for eclipse in /usr/bin
Nothing there
then you don't have the binary then
So the package is worthless then?
no its good you probably just didn't install eclipse fully did you install Eclipse-core?
zsh is the ultimate power shell however :).  you get used to tcsh after a while..
I like ZSH ;)
zsh ralley!. *rally
tcsh is too different from just about every other shell
oh I see.  How to disable it?
Comment out the 'start on' section.
so Ubuntu does not honor sysv runlevel system, I should not count on what I see in sysv-rc-conf, right?
Ubuntu uses upstart, but I believe it still uses runlevels.
Is there a tool for /etc/init like sysv-rc-conf for /etc/init.d?.  how can I know what services is enabled and what is not?
initctl list ?
How can I configure what services to start ?
sudo service <name> start ?
How can I choose what services to start during booting?. like sysv-rc-conf, or ntsysv in redhat systems
Configure stuff in /etc/init/ or /etc/init.d/
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=100M conv=notrunc. according to my logic, this shouldn't be possible at all
And you booted a live cd, for running that command?
I did it inside the 14.04 netinstaller (switched to another tty)
Reboot the netinstaller.
good good!
[URL]  just instead of "find /boot/grub/stage1", you do "find /boot/grub/menu.lst".  the rest of the steps remain same.
im currently on gentoo. will these instructions work for it?
it will work on gentoo also yes
okee dokee
the idea is to rewrite the bootsector with grub loader
is it best to do this from a livecd, as my reading seems to indicate, i merely ask for a second opinion
if you have the live cd probably better to do it from there; though there shouldn't be any difference if you have latest version of grub in gentoo
Sorry? I don't understand
there is a technology called EDID that tells systems what resolutions and refresh rates are possible. Cheap screens dont do thisand require manual settings by the user.  some users find they need to make an [URL]nf to tell the system how to work rather than the hardware working it out
I've been playing around with xrandr, but it errors when I try and force it
if you run: sudo nvidia-xconfig ,it will make an [URL]nf file. You can then reboot and it may help
error for moving the files
What error? You're telling us nothing.
Yes, exactly
what kind of hard drive is windows on? ide or sata?
sata
you could try fdisk -l in the terminal and see if you can see it there
sata, but my friend changed that in bios, I think. Nevertheless, it was fine in Gutsy.  Yes, I can see it
i think you need to mount it but im too nooby to know how
I tried that, but answer was that it is busy
did you shut down windows properly or did you just power it off?
DiCahill: I did proper shutdown.  I did proper shutdown
then i'm not sure what to suggest.  im on the livecd at the moment and i can't get any output at all from fdisk -l
Interestingly enough, I did live before install, and then I could see my win partition.
my drives all worked fine in gutsy.  i might install gutsy and upgrade
the flash player is working fine, it only seems to be one video now. not sure what that was. the video I want to watch though just wont play :s
having an issue sshing into terminal. input doesn't appear. until I press enter. okay so after calling Python (which exits with error message) no characters appear after typing
yes.  yes it is. rt on hardy worked with fglrx.
hmmm, i don't know much about real-time kernels. i don't know.  what version of the fglrx driver?
what would you do on a normal kernel?.  I dont know. I have tried to install whatever is in the Ibex repo.
i don't think there is an fglrx driver in the Ibex repo... unless they recently added it, because ati only recently cam out with an fgrlx driver that works with kernel 2.6.27. s/cam/came
not this then? [URL]
i would download the this file... ati-driver-installer-8-12-[URL]n, make it executable, and then run it while i'm in x-windows, then reboot... that's how i would install it.  ok. going to look at link now..  looks like an older version of the fglrx driver than the recent fglrx 8.12 release. my version is... 8.56.4
what userlist?
[URL]
python easier than perl?
Up to you, really.
hi!.  i was wondering does the "kernel" leave out unnsesery loadings on startup ?.  making ubuntu faster? (ubuntustudio)
un-necessary ? what do you consider un-necessary?
well all demonsa?. deamons
ah...try #ubuntustudio.or you can see for your self,press ctrl+alt+F1 after booting. !studio
is it better than frontpage or dreamwaver
no, but you're asking in the Ubutu channel, so I assume you want it to run on Linux.  no, but you're asking in the Ubutu channel, so I assume you want it to run on Linux
it's not a big deal to add the URL manually but why bother?
or wait :)
either submit an enhancement bugreport or?
wait :)
until 2.12 or until someone bothers to fix it
basically yes. apache2. apache2ctl stop. or /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
I don't know how to set permissions. The command I tried didn't seem to work.
Why are you trying to write to that directory?.  You are probably trying to do something you are not suppoed to be doing
Its where the IRCd saves the info
What IRC?
bitlbee IRCd
xchat or gaim does not
I'm talking about IRCd, not IRC clients.
is that Canonical supporteD?
As in, my box is an IRC server.
Maybe try #ubuntu-server
i didn't try, but i can do that now :)
go to alsa home, download newest, untar, readme configure, make make install.
: can't i do anything through the add/change program thingy? synaptics?
do it by hand, you will be sure you have the newest
when I use sudo chown -hR root:nobody /pub the result is "chown: invalid group: 'root:nobody'"
Edoctoor: you need to create the group nobody
And that is back to my question... how do I create a group nobody
Edoctoor: I am not presently in my linux box. I think the command is addgroup. There is also Users and Groups gui in xfce...don't know about unity
how?
[URL]
I don't have a working graphic interface. on any of my computers
it uses the liveCD / USB...
nope
please open a terminal and run a "sudo apt update" and show the output in a pastebin please
Did you get a security warning with the latest Lucid updates?
Any particular package? Not really since i do "dist-upgrade -y", chacking apt logs now.
no i am not. maybe i need some soft. or anything else
all that is copied into the buffer is 6 asterisks, they don't carry anything with them, I think you are a little crazy if you don't see that
thank you
for what? but you're welcome, anyhow!
what is the CLI command for it?
you didn't answer my question, what are you trying to accomplish ?
: I think you need to install ffmpeg first, the next isn't included past ubuntu 14
i thought i did install it. ill try again then
okay, so what exactly shows in /dev ?
any devices that udev has shown
udev is a program?
yup, it's a progra that handles devices
no, i want the certain applications on docky with a certain desktop environment
i see
like midori on GNOME, chrome on xfce for example
i dont think i could be possible
I mean what I just frikkin said. equalizer. not volume control.
!aumix
Debian GNU/Linux 7 \n \l.  ^
this is not debian support. the clue is the channel being called #ubuntu and not #debian
thats exactly the entry. I had, beside of my settings inserted
does the samba share have username and password set or does it allow guest login?
username and pass. it works "by hand" after bootup
you do have smbfs installed, don't you
I have
strange
correct, but it is going to be installed onto a supermicro, not a mac
they are both intel, correct?
have to check the mac, but i think so
feel free and refer to the link above.. its how to make a bootable usb from osx..
I installed madwifi-tools, and went to hardware drivers and it says it is working
ok
no
you have no live? is this broken on the computer your at. Basically we need more details, a little cause and effect you know.
Mrs B. I am new to the ubuntu 11. I don't see "Options" anywhere.
you said you were using transmission?
Yeah. I see File Edit Torrent View and Help in the top bar.
In transmission, click on the edit menu then preferences, select the network tab
And a Properties button in Transmission.. K
where it says Listening Port, click the Test Port button, see what it tells you
Says port 51413 is closed.
Is the Use UPnP box ticked?
Yes
UPnP is probably disabled at your router, the easiest way to fix the problem is to enable it there
Try what again? The Super GRUB Disk?
ya
Okay, but what do I do with it? I can't tell what menus will help me and what menus will break me.
try looking on the SUper GRUB disk site.. that and read the help on the disk itself
yea flash drive
big enough for the win-parti ?
w3d: matthewv walked me through manually patching a buggy program from the hardy repo with a path file that wasn't official yet, to get my GUI based fstab editor working correctly :). path-patch*
awesome, sounds like a good project
w3d: was interesting ;) i've learned so much in my 2 days using linux my head might just explode :) good think a 2 week vacation starts in 2 days
lucky you, i have to prepare for university now
w3d:: i'll keep that in mind while i'm skydiving in new zealand
well, its a year away but still im looking forward to it, so ive just starting using linux based systems.. haha, nice.
still? i thought they went to 5
as xfce provides only 3 years support, xubuntu = 3 years
yeah i thought they went up to 5 too
sadly, no. LTS
okay. i have a nvidia card now. it was awesome, ubuntu found the driver and it worked automatically
yeah nvidia kicks ass
yes nvidia is good but it sucks for mining bitcoins
for the price of electricity, you'll probably find bitcoins aren't worth it
Well, Ubuntu 13.10 is feeling sluggish, everything slow to open and reaction time is bad....  This system has 2.8GB ram..I thought it should be able to run Ubuntu fast and with no problem, but something doesn't feel right.
32 or 64 bit?
It's a laptop
did you smart test the drive?
in ubuntu how do i start stop a service ? i used to redhat
have a look for the script for that service in /etc/init.d
then i can add start at end of it ?
yes, start stop or restart usually work. depending on the script
what is gksudo ?
a GUI for sudo
their is?. there*
hold on will find it for u
it can, but i've tried it, and it's mind numbingly slow
next question,  :) Can I boot from a usb flash drive with / on 2 mirrored usb flash drives?
like raid?
raid1 yeah
no idea, sorry.  oh and a hint... don't use ext3 or ext4
ext2 most probably. and a ramdisk, post boot. awesome stuff, nankura
you know ubuntu makes a ramdisk by default, right?
ah yeah so it does,
Huh?
you seem to be some kind of angree and to sleep one night and to try ist again on an other day may help
package name?
one sec while i dig it up.  try gnome-compiz-manager and get compiz-extra as well i think those are the names
whats that do?
err, ulimit.  changes the maximum size of the core file
?
as i understand, the default is 0 which means no core file
oh. k
try 'ulimit -c unlimited'.  that'll only work for processes started in that shell
java -jar filename.  from console
what was the name of the program again?
Rachota 2.3 from [URL]
thanks, ill look at it and see if I can help
thx!
what jre are you running?
I installed Mandrake back when it was 8.x I think
well than you cant say it was the least painfull intall. caus eI find gentoo install easy aswell
I said it's the least painful I've done
rc-up:>. np
it says md0 recovery 5.4%
are sdb sdc sdd listed in the output?
that's too bad, imo REALLY too bad, i really need it unfortunatly ;(
"need"? why?
yeh when you told me to
do you have a little speaker icon in your tray?
i do i do i doo-oo
right-click it and select "preferences".
yep, what next|
the device should read HDA Intel (Alsa mixer). If it doesn't, select it from the drop down list.
it does indeed read HDA Intel etc
right click it again and select "Open Volume Control"..  unmute everything.
('cause it should load *before* using /dev/mapper/nvidia_ifififi
i really don't know a thing about any flavor of RAID, sorry...
okay, thanks anyway :)
DemisM: hardly, if you're using ext3. you might be able to use the "testdisk" package ("photorec" programs) for some filetypes...
will try now
it might also help if you get rid of the quiet parameter there, then you see better what's going on...
removed both splash and quiet yes.  i'm going to assume that a list of buffer i/o error on device fd0 etc isn't supposed to be there right?
Do you have a floppy at all?
nope.  wait ...
then I would tend to ignore it...
darn ... :( still reboot ... just when it was supposed to launch x
Try the alternate boot cd with noapic and noacpi....  maybe it's todo with the GraphicsCard
i'm almost certain it does ... but it runs fine with windows ... even with vista ....  the alternate one dies just after configuring the resolutions for x
that sounds like more analysis is required.
Ok
are you experiencing problems you think might stem from this or anything?
it is a spinning drive, HGST Travelstar 7K1000
so not a TRIM issue then.  how is the disk connected to the PC? SATA? USB? something else?
SATA
the only thing I can think of is that the writes to the ext4 are small random writes, requiring lots of head seeking
it is a dd if=/dev/zero ... conv=fdatasync.  full command - dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sda1/test2 bs=1M count=100 conv=fdatasync
hmmm, I'm not sure then. ext4 has a reputation for being very fast, generally
it is the same with ext3 and vfat, I tested it.  only ext2 seems to be fast there
well the big difference is ext4 will by default have a journal. maybe using dumpe2fs on both may show some obvious difference.  does the drive use Advanced Format (large sectors)
Yes, I know, but there is no files starting with "mysql..."
dpkg -l | grep mysql.  probably not installed
Can't ever catch anyone over there...
be noisy
jeez I don't wanna pitch a fit
just explain your problem at great lenghts , and then go on to explain all the things you've tried,
=)
god people, just call me Trek. :P
Thank you, dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration seemed to do what I wanted
avorntur: welcome. ubuntu leaves out a lot of dpkg configurations during package installation. i suppose it makes sense for the target users
that 1 i can use but i need to configure the permission on my second hdd. so, how to configure that
do not log on as root, here is a help for your mounting issue: [URL]
ok. no :S. hmm. did not worked with. sudo apt-get install docks
nah, I meant the general term for those things is "docks", I do not know the name of one though, sorry.
okej. aha thx anyway. dam. hmm
try "apt-cache search docks".  and please don't use <enter> as punctuation.
yeah woked. thank u alot
ok, and you learned something too ;). no prob. later
downloading the warty ISO in a 6kbps line. 6kBps.  how?
i just know
ok i will try
from terminal.
i know, i am not that much of a noob(just a little bit)
no offense intented.
i have libdvdcss2
open totem menu and speicfy where the dvd is
no it wont let me. the power management just gime two options: hibernate and suspend but not shutdown. since none of the two given options work then I would like to shutdown
:\.  :\
No I don't have the Ubuntu phone.. I've been trying to get Ubuntu-sdk working with the emulator but it's not working very well...
just wondering. I can't believe these are actually coming out. i haven't been following, have they hit the market yet?
can you please recommend me one?
gtkgo, cgoban, gnugo.
thank you!
of the three: gtkgo is probably your best bet
libflash-[URL]
there is the problem
what
sudo apt-get remove libflash-mozplugin && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
hindsight is 20/20, but I'm upgraded now,
upgrades are always dubious regardless of OS. tp_:got here before you ask anything [URL]
hm, lightdm is failing to run.
And what is the nature of that failure?.  cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log
not seeing anythign in the logs that lloks unusual so far, but dont' know exactly which to concentrate on, and don't necessarily know what is "good" or "bad" when I look at it.
first thing i thought when i read the question was a big cronjob, like a backup job or something, just a thought. but that would be repeating on a very stable pattern i suppose, it's not every week? :)
no, it's not consistent; have had it happen twice in one day, but that was about a month ago. Just happenend about 10 minutes agao.
when it happens you can try 'top' or 'htop' to find what processes are possible culprits ..
@vamp898 1) the speakers work but using the headphone jack does nothing, I am unaware of a way to test different ways to make it work. 2) After installing Ubuntu I can not load windows from the dual boot screen. When selected that way the screen takes on the default ubuntu screen color and sits there indefinitely. I can go into the BIOS and load into windows though. Its EFI if thats pertinent
but when you plugin the headphone jack, there is no more sound on the speakers, right?
vamp898: there is still sound coming threw the speakers
That doesnt sound good (i mean, maybe it does, maybe those are good speakers, but i mean more like your problem :D)
haha. yeah!
What Notebook is it?
can u help me about views
view's in regard to what
i have created the calendar clone. i want it to display it in page content
what are you talking about ?
: i try , but no one reply.. :-(
not our problem, we support Ubuntu here, not FreeNAS
i used warez-[URL] to dl it and i dl one cd from rapid share and another from [URL]
if the page is covered 60 % with ads then i suggest you to look for other sources
can't i avoid that?
you might be able to with mplayer.  chekc out its options with man mplayer
playing the directly the .bin movie?
yeah
well yes i am to an external hd
it doesn't support files greater than 4GB
do you know which filesysystem would?.  do you know which would?
does windows need to be able to read it?
well my ps3 does. i would like if windows could read it as well. but its not a req atm.  my ps3 but i would like windows to if possible
I don't know what filesystems a ps3 can handle .. I think that the kernel needs to support it .. I really don't know much about windows filesystems sorry :(
heh well is there a filesystem with linux that i could use to xfer it?
any one you like
Thanks a ton! will read!.  I promised I googled first ;-)
no worries, hope it works.
ati radeon 9550 , installed the driver from add/remove software
err, what driver are you using in /etc/X11/[URL]nf?
it dosent say nothing about a driver ...
okay, and you do have xserver-xorg-video-ati installed right?
thanks
ssh-keygen -t dsa will generate a DSA keypair for your user.
and then i use that right?
Right.
?. The theme I was using was called simple or something
setup (hd0,n)
I cant even login anymore
setup (hd0) = mbr. change n to where you want the grub be. 0 = 1 or hda1 = hd0. sorry. nps. where are the file to config the hibernate ?
same driver just a newer version
why ?
i wanted to use the injecting feature of aircrack
ahh so you where trying to do cracking
Under "Desktop Integration"? When I select an "Item" I find that the font button is grayed out. Does this mean I haven't got any fonts installed?
probably
to burn dvd's using a burner that supposedly only burns using nero
do you still have the receipt?
what receipt?
for the burner...
it was an online purchase, I can still return it but 90% make you use nero
I've never heard of that
k > ill look again at log in. i can chose what de to use but i dont see nothing that says chose defualt or what ever
"default" will be the most recently selected DE
gutsy
are you using compiz?
yes
try disabling it and see if that works
What works?
what game are you trying to run?
I want to know how to minimize Wesnoth.
turn off and compiz and see if that works. -and
How much "free" drive space
df -h
If I created the live USB while allocating the rest of the entire memory to store system settings, would "df -h" say that my drive is full? I used the System->Administration->create a USB startup disk application to make my life USB
tokenekie, df -h shows ALL mounted drives, total space, free space, used space. That's all it does..  just type it and see, you'll understand.
Yeah, but it says my 1.9g live USB drive is completely full, which I dont believe. Unless it actually is full
things like Live CDs it will display as 100% full. But it if says 100% full, then I'd believe it.
Figured. Who's the owner of the file?
me. it seemed to appear after I used bleachbit
Always a bad idea
could be related to this [URL]
lol.  I'd just delete it. Can't be something important. If it starts with 0 bytes
will do. another thing. possible OT, but how do I post install windows 7?
You mean after you installed Ubuntu?
yep yep
You kinda did the wrong way around :p. Since, whenever you install Windows 7 now, grub will be affected
can't I reinstall grub? supergrubdisk used to do that automatically
So, how this works. Run gparted. Create your windows partition.. Install Windows 7. Use your live USB to install grub again. And it will fix it
what do I install on the usb?
so no way to verify then?
dont think so, if it is so, you dont need backups..
it makes sense to back up my data, but not to back up various OS files
os files are your data too.  but you can reinstall the os and use your backup of your own files
i mean like for vdeo cards
xorg
The port is most definitely open.  I was just running deluge on that port, I uninstalled deluge, installed transmission, configured it for the same port. and I double checked the software firewall..  However according to my port scan, my server isn't responding on port 9002.  What should the rpc bind address be?.  I have the whitelist as false, rpc bind address 0.0.0.0 rpc port as what I need.
hmm tbh i have no idea :(
Could I see a copy of your configuration file?.  ?
@clueless sorry no don't have it installed atm
10
hmmm
Ah, good to know. Yeah I knew it was possible between Linux hosts, but I didn't want to go on a wild goose chase trying to do it with Windows if it wasn't possible.. thanks
ok :).  looks like the windows pulseaudio now has steam over network suport... cool :).  [URL]
what driver did you use?
the iwl3945 one..  is yours a b43xxx one !
well, that's what i did
you have a raw dump of the disk then?.  the real problem is if your inode structure is destroyed, you need some tricky hacks to find out how exactly each file is scattered across the disk. and the system tools are best for that, their written by the ext designers, who know the ins-and-outs
well, badblocks did show up a couple of bad inodes
if the disk is mounted, i'd unmount it to avoid further writes to the disk.  then, run fsck to try to repair the inode structure
<>  desktop, unless you want to install via ncurses --- (looked it up) nope. Thanks. Do you know will xubuntu handle wireless on a Dell laptop (older, 504 MB RAM, works on Windows - when Windows works)
what wireless? (it should work).  though you may want to try lxde with just that much ram
thanks...have you used it will it rip encrypted dvds like say how dvddecrypter does?
yes, I have used it. Yes, it will rip CSS-encrypted DVDs. No, I don't know what dvddecrypter is.
go get nautilus-actions
Yeah, I did, and that's a bit too complex for me. I know I can add actions, but I'd like to edit the existing ones.
<Overlord> not yet. Let me try that. <Overlord> I added a resolution to the vga-1 monitor, now how do i switch to that mode?.  thanks! that fixed it. I appreciate the help
sweet, no problem
no
well is there an error message at all when you run it from terminal?. pfft
they're .pcf
OK, I'm no font expert - I just know you specifically have to enable bitmap fonts
which video card? i don't have this problem with an NVIDIA + Beryl. beerocks: but i'm not using XGL though
Ati X1900GT, I think it's a problem with XGl, though
beerocks: unortunately you have to use XGL for desktop effects with your ATI cards
yeah, I know :(
o/  thx. nah,  unfortunately hostapd -d explicitly states that it fails at this certain capab, removing it from old previously working config makes things spin heh. but thanks
the hostapd config file should list the HT_capab and it could be an issue, see ... [URL]
this certain line used to work with ralink on pci bus since idk 12.04 probably (can't remember well) until 16.04 "ht_capab=[SMPS-STATIC][GF][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40][HT40-][HT40+][RX-STBC12][TX-STBC1]". after proceeding to 16.04 it is enough to remove [SMPS-STATIC] from it to make it work, i wonder what is the reason for it, since iw lists it
idk, seems things changed in hostapd moving to 16.04
ext4
stupid quetion, but is there a problem on it to make you want to fsck it ?
Got some processes going into D, rebootet the server, and trying to do a fsck. Might have been some latency to SAN causing the state D
going into D ?
uninterruptible sleep
I'd be very concerned if your san had that much latency fsck was timing out
fsck is not timing out, but seems to be "find / |xargs rm" was the first process going into uninterruptible sleep
how many disks are making up the volume group that the logical volume is in
two
fsck is timing out if it's giving an out of memory error
yes...  but I just installed..:0.  am a newbie to this development porcess though..:)
oh, hmm, I guess it does still exist.  probably need to do a apt-get install <lib>:i386 if you need the 32-bit library for soemthing
=(
could you please also put /var/log/Xorg.0.log on the paste-bin ?
hang on. its crashing
explore2fs ?
yupz
it can break on big files, as i said
damn
the version i used seemed to copy the whole file into main memory (!) before writing it to disk
wad version was that
dunno. i'm not on windows, so i can't check ;)
ic. brb
it may not be much help, but you can use the 'split' program (in linux) to split a file into chunks
heh. i wanna watch my movie on windows
and then reassemble in windows using copy /b
but each file is like 200+ meg. and i only have 128meg ram
i think ext2fsd supports read-only of ext3 partitions. You can try that too.  [URL], afaik. heh
i would like to use the latest release
extract it somewhere and run the 'qtorrent' binary. Installing QTorrent is not necessary
no, i mean having the cpu run at a certain percentage, i guess. this is for an experiment
percentage of what?
well, like in top where it tells you the cpu usage in percentage
i do not think is easily doable (or even possible)
That's my only way out
and you have the latest version of gnome-panel?
Backports enabled.  ???
I totally missed what you said
Backports enabled
are you asking if they should be, shouldn't be, are, aren't what?
I mean, i have latest version on repos
ok, try killall gnome-panel and see if it works on reload.
Nope
thats really strange.
Weird, in my mom's account it works fine
usually its not one applet that gives problems but the whole panel or nothing,
Should i remove it and put it again?
anything is worth a try, but it sounds like the applet itself is bad or corrupt or sending the wrong signal
13.10
there's instructions for resetting unity here --> [URL]
sorry. couldn't resist the urge
take it elsewhere
how do i open gnome control center. im completely new to linux
You should be able to just search for "control" -> and an option for either Unity control center or Gnome control center will show (should show)
no, but the power drawn through the port shouldn't exceed 500mA. so lack if power isn't it...
if you draw 500mA through two unpowered hubs, i'm pretty sure you are exceeding the power budget.  anyway, USB only allows for one consecutive level of unpowered hubs.
really! thanks :) that's what i've been doing wrong then...
good luck
fujitsu: thanks.  does that install libs for KDE Archive manager, or is it it's own thing?
It should work with both Ark and it's own thing, I think, .
got it, thanks a lot :)
No problem, .
This is an i1200 from the end of 2001, I couldn't get dapper or breezy to even load. It would freeze up at the hardware and cd-rom detect thing at 86%.  I read a bunch of things on the forums, yet nothing was able to get me past it
warty freezes up on this one when its checking apt sources
although warty installed just fine so who knows lol
yeah. i gave up and learnt to deal with windows
well, the thing is, i don't need to repeat the command after i log out and log in but only after i shut down and start new.  you still there?
Yup, somewhat.
using the RSA key?
no, the host name
ok i had to reinstall OS, and thats why i am getting this error, do i put the old host name or the new one?
quote me the exact error you're seeing
idk what were they, but i know, they were the default ones
the default usa servers?. for ubuntu?
yeah i noticed, just havent been able to use it yet
you pipe it in to programs that prompt you endlessly to just answer yes to everything. it's kind of useless these days
yes I know lol, I was just saying I couldnt figure out HOW to set the target for output
you pipe it
how often does that usually happen?.  I know there is not a set schedule. it seems it happens often
usual kernel updates come every 2-3 weeks. security fixes are shipped asap after testing
do you normally do a full reboot then or you use a program that installs an update without reboot?
yes. kernel updates need full reboot. for 16.04 LTS (since that is what servers run) you can use the canonical live patch service.  i reboot my laptop at least once a day. so that is not an issue for me.
that can patch without reboot?. that live patch service?
[URL]
it's partially checked, has the - rather than the checkmark
try to check it... (you can revert it)
just tried that and it keeps going from checked to partially checked. I'm assuming the Source Code checkbox in Software & Updates is what you are referring to
no Synaptic
ah okay, will look at that now.  where is the sources checkbox?
Settings - Repositories
that's the software & updates app I was in
Synaptic Package Manager ? and you can't check "source code" ?
using synaptic package manager and opening settings -> repositories opens the Software & Updates app. I can uncheck Source Code and then check it again but it has the - rather than the checkmark. It looks like I'm able to install the keptback package using synaptic though, so I'm doing that. Will see if it fixes the issue
i just installed it without issue
yessir
you can either chroot and remove the driver, or modify the files in etc/modprobe.d to blacklist the module.  you can mount the internal partitions from the live CD and do both
its 16.10
as Plasma in 16.04 is rather... volatile, you'll want to use kubuntu backports PPA or stuff like that might happen regardless of secure boot or no..  ah ok. well, try a reboot I guess. it still acts up in 16.10 :p
i have installed ubuntu 2 monts ago. I have a live cd, and thats all. There isn`t much on it. and i insstalled everything from it
I was talking about live-DVD.
I know, i dont have one
download it ;)
OK, I'll give that a crack. But as I recall, I think I tried that. Maybe I have to move the iso into nautilus first.
that is right
thanks, sidewinder
:D
not starting on boot. im able to log into the tty ...
can you pastebin /etc/grub/grub.cfg
i think my nvidia driver update screwed things up. yes jst a sec. @fifo, no such file or directory. @ no such file or directory
/boot/grub/grub.cfg then
@ [URL]  [URL]
did you recently upgrade?
just my nvidia drivers.  my ubuntu is quite old
I see 3 kernels listed, did you upgradethe kernel too?
what sould i use for that?
look in dmesg to see if the drive is throwing errors
_ where is that?
just run dmesg in terminal and look for anything to do with the drive
I have nvidia. actually its a tablet pc. so in windows vista it rotates by default
I've had trouble getting it to work reliably. Once nVidia supports the new XRandR 1.2, it'll be a snap....  for now, though, you can put it into the 'Device' section of your /etc/X11/[URL]nf file..  it's just one line, Option "RandRRotation" "true"
I 'll try
then when your X server is running, try 'xrandr -o left' from the command line.
back leading to this state?. I changed some settings in my NVIDIA x service and now it appears to have stopped working. it was working fine up until now
In other words have you done anything that has led you to not having the animations, like graphic drivers messing with compiz....etc
Thanks
on a scsi 15000 rpm drive at 80gigs it takes 45 minutes,,.  on usb connection that same drive would take a few hours
sata hooked up usb. thanks  just means I have to wait till later tonight to reinstall the os on my laptop. finally configured my windows VM for work so I can stop duel booting
well once the command has been used by the drive,, zeroing move as fast as the drive can handle.  i would just start the zeroing and go watch a few movies or something :)
its been running for 1.5 hours
yep and it will run even longer,,, not much of anything that can be done about that,,,
I have actually been reading man pages and trying to figure out why I am getting errors setting up some things
what are you using to zero the drive ,, Dban ?
how can i boot to single mode?
press esc at boottime and select it in the boot menu
ok thanks. any idea on how to change the time zone in 7.04?
oops it is not there!
then I have 12.04 LTS
or use update manager
thanks (I only have terminal as it's a server)
not true
Ok, so when I resize Vista, it will use say the first half of the drive right? Then I just make a few EXT3 partitions for Ubuntu and make one a /boot?
if you install grub to the mbr you still will be able to boot windoze vista
And the computer will use Grub like normal?.  I can't. I got Truecrypt encrypting my whole hard drive.
remove it.  we have better then true link
If I remove it my computer will become unusuable.
then dont
I'd have to decrypt everything..  Can I use the Vista bootloader somehow?
make one /boot partiton at +32m . make one swap partition with +512m . make one partion / with the remaining space
Uhh whoops?. !ops. Thanks.
windows will not allow it. windows will only accept windoze. there are alternatives to grub that are windows installable however ......google
Ok. Yeah I think I will. :\
have fun. hehehehehehe
Hence the !ops command.. :D
hey were helping you here. be nice. libc6 was broken
???
i have ubuntu instaled on my hp pavilion dv6000
pre-installed, out of the box?
no full hd
i just need remote desktop to an ubuntu install
nx is much faster so if possible use nx
thats what i thuoght, i see freenx doesn't appear to be updated. shuold i try the ones from nomachine?
they are non-free, if possible use freenx

You don't have the key for medibuntu. Did you add that repo yourself?.  Oh, wait. Scratch that
Yes. I readded it, and I readded the pgp too.
Hold up.  Pastebin your sources please
[URL]
Either of the 2 ppa repos don't have the keys added. Could you try adding them again?
Ok. Done. Should I "sudo apt-get update"?
sudo aptitude update, aptitude over apt-get is preffered :)
Hmm... Never used aptitude. Same thing pretty much?
Very much the same
alright...
apt-get install traceroute
I know nothing about clean thermal pase off my cpu - try searching [URL]
oh that is why  didnt know
is there another driver somewhere besides the ATI which would work?
mmm I don't think
I installed fglrx through software center.
Ati, Nvidia?
Ill check that
maybe the solution:.  go to [URL]/ and let it search for bluetooth.h
will it resolve to sfree86-devel in a dependency check??
no it's not, sorry. my bad.  pardon for just joining in, why do you need it?
because I'm going to install cadega CVS as it's free and I need wine
ok, cool :)
internal
ok, PATA or SATA?
2 SATA 1TB drives. I was on the live CD half an hour ago and they mounted fine.  sorry 500GB, 1TB I wish :D
ok, do they show up in bios and stuff
they show up in ubuntu, but when I try an access them it says they could not be mounted.  I'll paste the error message (don't worry not here)
sure
having problems with my [URL]nf file
what sort of problems
he doesn't have linux thu?
so: scp, ftp, nfs, smb,...
I'm not so interested in disabling it.. Is there some way to install an older X than what this koala provided me with?
im, saying there are ways it may allready be disabled...
Well no. It's enabled. It's a bug in recent X.
err. the system speaker/beep from what i know - is not related to X.. Gnome/kde/other desktops/wms alsy may have their own 'alert' stuff.
I can't get tvtime or mythtv to work on my system, how can I be sure that my tv-card is installed correctly?
untill you can get a program in there, I'm not sure. I'm working my way out of the Samba issue, and then I'm moving on the CUPS and then MythTV
this is called port forwarding? how do I know the port for vnc?.  and that would be modem firmware settings yes?
ususually 5900 or 5901. see man page.  modem 'firmware' - actually firewall
ok, but I change firewall settings in the modem firmware, or does Ubuntu have a default firewall too?
usually with some web front end accessed by navigating to http://192.168.0.1 (or something like that)
nice  it can label mounted partitions. now, can I label a nfs share mounted in fstab?
Yepper, linux been around a while, if you can think of it, someone sometime has done it :)
what about a cortana assistant with some nice animations around a pole?
labrl 'nas' in the mount. nope, that is not the function of the file system table ..  Yeah "you" can do that .. gimp to the resue .
just for fun. :).  experimenting with command propmt
ah if it's just for fun you should go work that out by yourself :p
so that envelope app on the top right does do email notification?
no, sorry, not as far as i know. I just thought you might want to try the python workaround.
i executed "sudo gpasswd -a  vboxusers" and restarted, but i still doesn't work
you have a old Vbox upgrade to 2.1
alright, thanks. <>what do you recommend, OSE or the closed source version
[URL]
hehe. Suspend got fritzy. I don't REALLY want to downgrade, I just can't figure out how to get the 4.4 kernel entry included in the grub bootup menu. update grub only sees the 4.0 kernel. 4.10* kernel
update-grub doesnt work?
it seems to work, but it doesn't make an entry for each kernel on my machine
have you rebooted since the upgrade?
several times...
uname -a
is this abberent behavior?.  4.10.0-32-generic #36~16.04.1-Ubun.  I thought it was just some new feature of grub2
thats the right kernel your in good shape :)
but 4.8 and 4.4 seem to work better on this old hardware
how so?. what broke?
the 4.10 kernel will not resume after a suspend.  the 4.4 kernel does for instance.  I thought the 4.8 kernel did too...
so it will suspend cleanly but not wake ?
it would be hard to debug without serial console, the hardware is very 'exotic' it is a dual quad core xeon macpro2,1. from 2006
well never had to sort that out before, but found this guide.... [URL]  so just to make sure, the old kernel images are still in /boot right?
right, but to debug the system would take more hardware than I have.  right, all the images are where they should be.  maybe I don't understand the boot menu entries..  I will RTFM.  Thanks for your help. Does update-grup also perform a grub-install?
shouldnt need to grub-install
I thought so too...
but should be able to edit /etc/default/grub to show the other kernel versions.  [URL] should fix ya up
right... ... but i am not sure i see the 4.4 and 4.8 kernel entries in the grub menu.  ahhh Advanced options for Ubuntu. okay, see oldtimers like me get confused when stuff is so pretty and tucked away. Hehe I still feel nostalgic for grub1 and sysV... gotta learn all this new stuff for ubuntu.  thanks again
anytime buddy.. dont worry im back to the learning curve with ubuntu as well and lots changed since in my absense haha happy to help!
have you seen journalctl -xe?
sure havent, whats that?
try it. it is sorta amazing for debug. it is the systemctl logging frontend. or something
ahhh... sounds pretty snazzy, ill take a peek. thank you :).  you pretty good with samba connections?
not since 2008....  how bad is it?.  I gotta reboot to see if I can get the older kernel working.. have fun with journalctl -xe
perfect i shall, good luck pal
kay, thanks  - will check it out
no,wait.  it won't be root (hd0,0) because you have a separate boot partition.  so it will be root (hd0,#) where # is 0 for hda1, 1 for hda2, etc.
yeah, think so
if vlc won't play it, I don't know
that worked for the folders in desktop, but do you know how to specify which folder to make a list of?.  actually I just found out how, thanks a lot
Strom_C_: "command & >/dev/null 2>&1" do what you want?
Hmm.. "sda contains GPT signatures, etc... However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.". Interesting. wtf did 7 do to this partition table?
Windows can't boot from GPT on BIOS systems to it creates a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table which violates the GPT specification.
Right, but parted is indicating that the MBR portion is missing?
The MBR portion should only have one partition, spanning the entire drive, to protect against partitioning applications that don't understand GPT..  As much as I dislike the legacy cruft of msdos partition labels, getting rid of GPT entirely for this disk may be the easiest way to allow Ubuntu to cooexist with the legacy cruft of Microsoft's bootloader :(
yes, everything works fine . [URL]
Idk what to say, restart system and try again?.  Is this an ongoing issue?
yes.. nothing works after many restart.. fdisk doesn't show my usbstick. Same results after several restart.  but dmesg return me detection output. maybe some of you, know a tools to for usb recovery
Dumb question, but have you confirmed the stick is working on other distros/cpus?
yes. it's not a new one. Yesterday it was working
Can you format it, or do you have important stuff on there?.  And was it working on that distro yesterday?
yes.  that's way I m sure , usb stick is down. And I m trying to recover data
When you restarted it was the stick in or out?
it's an Intel ICH5 AC95 compliant (built-in on an Asus mobo)
is it one of those hda chipsets?
HDA? not sure what that is. It's an old Socket 478 mobo with AGP
open up a terminal and "lspci" and see exactly how it idenfiies your sound device
I've checked that out before, but it is: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02).  oops, AC97 compliant, sorry.  aplay -l reports two devices at bus 0 and 4, both AC97
[URL]
so whan this scroll keeps all scrolls what should i get ?. the prompt will be back ?
it should return you to the shell prompt, then yo enter that command I gave you and it should fire up gdm (login screen) so you can log into gnome.
considering i know little about scripting - how difficlut would that be?
Not difficult at all. If you know the commands you want to use you just put them in a file and mark it executable, more or less.  With cron you could just put the command in your crontab even
can i use a rsync command ?
yes.  See "man 5 crontab" for information about how to set the schedule, then you just put the command afterwards
cron comes with ubuntu right? so i just need to figure out the command and put in cron cron-tab? how do i make it back-up every night at 9 oclock?.  ok,,,,is there a gui for cron?
Not that I know of, it's not really that complicated though
The center and front channels do not produce noise.
and have you used the mixer?
alsamixer?
kind. sort of
I ran it and it jumped down to another line ready to go, sounded like hdd was doing something though. will you still be here in ten minutes or so? I gotta run to pick up my dinner
ya im will be here
ya. i mean nautilus. so long... i forgot what it was called
the other machines on your network are running sftp? if so, you should see the sftp servers listed in "Network" in nautilus.
sorry
no problems here
viewing /var/log/messages; reinstalling gdm and acpid, sestting AutomaticLoginEnable=false in /etc/gdm/[URL]nf so i wont auto go to failsafe mode, tried to run gdm on failsafe mode but couldnt unlock the dialog
and what is your error message?
var/log/messages shows: error: X11 initilization failed... .. and opening up xorg0.log i see only two warnings (WW)_: Falling back to old probe method for vesa; Falling back to old probe method for fbdev
so X11 seems to be the problem. or xorg. there are no more error messages?
well, thanks for the tip I'll try that, but still wouldn't mind input from the channel on KB software :)
google linux ?
interesting! that makes sense. i was not aware. true enough :).  do you have an opinion on [URL] ?
UUI is fine, yeah
and as --version. pls? :)
of what executable?
as. assembler
oh, sorry. missed it there
:-)
2.15
Mine keeps getting wiped :/
Seems odd. They are created/mounted by the live distribution and shouldn't be affected by the installed OS.  (afaik)
I just installed dapper yesterday, shouldn't need a fresh install already...
gretyl: then i misunderstand your question. gretyl: try me again maybe. gretyl: grey matter might work better this time.
I'm having trouble starting up mac-on-linux
gretyl: what is that? you mean you are having trouble booting your machine running linux that happens to be motorola / ppc powerd?. gretyl: last time a checked a 'mac' was nothing more than a motorola / ibm chip with a bunch of other garbage components.
no, mac-on-linux is an environment where a PPC machine booted into Linux should be able to load Mac OS X inside a window
gretyl: ahhhhh..... gretyl: probably not the _defacto_ forum for mac questions.. gretyl: linux yes.. gretyl: but when you get back into mac, you are begging for pain.
well, it's the linux pkg that's failing me. not the mac part
gretyl: um does linux boot?
okay,
!backup
How are new packages installed? from tarball?
At most you'll get 10% improvement..  Thing is the gentoo folks don't actually provide benchmarks, they all just say everything runs faster.
it shows long list then?
yeah the config files are prepended with a . and those contain your info for that app i dont know which itll be
lol well it is... uts like its meant to be on a phone.. its so grosely simplified. liiiike... 4 days now. lol?
ya good point something less complex on a trial basis would be the way then work up. ha
ok, that still doesn't make it a good idea to install 13.10
mmmm yeah. you're right maybe 12.04 would be better
or figure out the problem and use 14.04
mmmm that takes time....
thanks, but it is a little more complex - I am doing via a gui...
I figured....
how ? netstat ?
i would use nmap
i don't have nmap installed
sudo apt-get install nmap
and if i want to have also installed the manual ? is there any way to install the manual for nmap (man nmap for ex)
its comming with the package nmap
thanks
learn to use apt-cache search. :)
don't be patronizing. I asked for a recommendation
:P
I would have loved to, but I had to change the UID numbers of two accounts so they'd match up with my laptop for NFS.  I've done this before on other Linux's and never had this problem
- think you can specify the UID number with the adduser command ... something like adduser --gid 1001 user
i have 1 (A+) and that's it. Ive been in the field for about 7 years.  my cert did nothing for me
yup, and EVERYBODY requires A+, even though the cert is 100% shite. but without it you cant even get a lowly tech position
most of the people where i work dont have any cers. certs*
where do you work? I need a job.. cause i have YEARS of real world experience
you have any experience?.  professional experience?
a couple years. but nothing in any one specialization. that's where having a cert or two would be nice
looks like its desktop support world for you ;).  what area of the world you live in?
not if i get these certs... i guarantee they'll land me a sysadmin or sysop position. ohio, usa. they just look all kinds of official, heh
good luck, i really hope it works like that for you.  what would be your ideal (realistic) job you would like to do?
I want to build call-center networks.. I have a knack for large-scale user networks
what kind of jobs have you done in the past?.  in field i mean
call center support, system administration, it director (small company, more like it department), lead technician, liason to corporate clients, in-depth troubleshooting (things other techs could not fix), city-wide school system network upgrade. umm. lots of stuff.
yes it is...Every file i place in there will be executed at boot?
no, it will execute if xinetd is on
ok.  but doesn't xinetd normaly start when I boot a machine?
it depends on your config, normally it does
all that will do is tell you my home directories.
and all your users have a home directory
yes.  the user list was already working. then it just quit.
that is a whole different sitiuation
is it safe?. to unistall i mean....
sure you can put it back later if you wish
kk. Thanks man :D
np ;]
Should i remove it via apt-get remove?
from the panel? just right click should do it, unless you want to completely remove networkmanager and use only command line to connect to internet
no it doesn't give me that option. its just's managing my dhcp right.... and I don't need it to manage that, I setup my router to do that
any special reason to remove it?
no, i just want my panel to be 19 px and its too big and the icon wont resize so I just said, w/e and I'll remove it
!info irssi
well for example i installed 12.04 yesterday and my video drivers werent working properly, my max resolution was set to 1024
video card/driver issues can be very dependent on the exact version of the drivers, and kernel. and xorg.
It was... I feel great I have never compiled kernel before..  someone told me to do that ealrier
so, after a bit of work, you'll compile the kernel.  but if you convince yourself that you don't have to do any work, what happens when you get to a step you don't understand?
I dig down deep, swallow my pride and move onwards
there is no need to swallow anything. Just take ten or fifteen minutes, read a how-to, and go do it.
im using the trial version at the moment
are you in North America?
ahh
I have umask=003. Works for all folders except for those that are linked to the personal folders in Vista
sorry, bit out of my area
it's a really strange problem that can't seem to be solved by simply doing some fstab stuff.. Distrojockey: so it seems to be for everybody :(
links to FAT should be fine, and access to them from Vista should also be painless
accessing from Vista is painless. Accessing from Ubuntu isn't. That's the thing..  Linking to it is fine as well
FAT does'nt even have permisions, so no idea what the issue could be, sorry
thanks for looking at it, I think I'll bump the thread once (or is that not allowed) and then maybe file a bug report
not sure on bumping rules but it has been a while, so worth a try.  good luck
Thanks!
I'm using rhythmbox...I was thinking of the play queue vs. play list.. My geekbook starts with my account open. It doesn't present a login screen... what to do?
try [URL]
it DOES take awhile?
It generates the locales. Depends on the speed of you r computer
I'm watching it in the terminal.......It's still on the first one (en_AU.UTF-8)......for about 15 min now. but i'll keep my eye on i. t. thanks
That certainly sounds wrong. Mine takes 1-2 min to do all
uh oh....
Installing or upgrading?
upgrading
You could try stopping it, and then run dpkg -configure -a
how do I "stop" the upgrade?. just kill it?
Ctrl+C :-)
I'm using the GUI. not directly from the CLI
ohh..try closing the windows then, if not you have to go into the terminal and kill it there, or the system monitor
yeah the "Close" option is grayed out. guess i'll manually have to kill it. this isn't gonna be pretty,...........................
nope...
good thing for TimeVault
never tried it
yeah. and I dont need that package
no
well somehow similar, but i need to to track my work
[URL] like ?
thank you, any good documentation on installing that windowmanager with ubuntu?
it's well integrated -- 'System-Preferences-Appearance-Desktop Effects'
I just bought a dell m4300 with a quadra gfx card... I am hoping it does a really nice job with this UI you speak of
it'll only work once you've enabled 3D acceleration on the driver side.
so just install normal ubuntu? no Kubuntu or Xubuntu?
was Ubuntu pre-installed?
in root user, ran crontab -e, added * * * * * /bin/echo "Test" >> /tmp/test123.txt. any ideas?
does the system have a desktop UI?
no only cli
is cron running as a service?
Yea i ran ps aux | cron
what does: service cron status output?

then you didnt run it right.
there are already crons running, checked syslog /USR/SBIN/CRON[21656]: CMD (/bin/local/qd live >/dev/null 2>&1)
is /tmp writable?
No sir. I have asserted this context menu item. Still my desktop does not arrange items in a grid.
I don't know how else to do it, sorry
koenigsegg the issue is that even though it connects me to the dc serverr and chat rooms and i can talk to everyone on the main chat and privately. When it comes to searching through the shared files or getting file lists i get no responses. Zilch! how do i configrue this ?
sounds like the usual thing with closed ports.
how do i fix the port problem
you have to configure your firewall, router etc to not block these ports and just let the data through
I dont know how to do it. koenigsegg ok ill try fixing my port issus. *issues
good luck
I'm not sure actually..  windows said 60, Ubuntu says 150
yes, but how big is it really? i mean whats written in the label?
I'd have to take it out to find out
and where do you see that space? the disk free application for example summs up all memory it finds, not just the 1st hd
disk usage analyser
that the one with the circle showing the sizes? that tool sums up all it finds.
Did it require any magic?
not that I remember. sounds were a problem for a while
Did you have an account already, or were you signing up for a new one with that install?
humm, yeah, it was a while back when I signed up
the driver is mwifiex, which is a Marvell driver.  how do I determine the chipset?. mwifiex_pcie*
sudo lshw -C network.  you can check there chipset & driver= loaded
is this the chipset? 88W8897.  I see the driver in the command output
chipset would be showed as first line, brand + type.  driver= at bottom
description: Wireless interface product: 88W8897 [AVASTAR] 802.11ac Wireless vendor: Marvell Technology Group Ltd..  first three lines^
ok good
that did not work.  any other sugestions?
nope sorry, im a noob but thats what helped me, gotta ask someone who actually knows stuff
I assume x-windows is running? I don't really know what that is.
do you have a colourful login screen, or just a black background with white text?
Colorful.
...or a desktop with graphical menus and so on
so it wouldn't be a driver issue
impossible to rule it out in the age of win-wifi, but apart from that I wouldn't expect the driver to cause a problem there..  do you know which driver you're using?
hashbox: i installed tightvncserver and i kept getting font errors. hashbox: i eventually gave up and tried vnc4server and it claimed it started (vncserver) but i can't connect
I was googling vnc servers before and saw something related to tightvnc server and font problems. Hmmm do you know which port it is starting the server on?
hashbox: i could probably figure out which port, does ubuntu lock all ports until explicitly opened?
im not sure, you could have a look at netstat
hashbox: how do i interpret netstat output?
well somewhere you should see a [URL]meportthatlookslikevnc I think, im not really sure sorry
hashbox: dont see it, so how do i enable that port?
does vncserver say anything about a port when you start it?
hashbox: 5901
did you try vnc into that port?
I try to exclude specific services. I googled but I'm not the most experienced in networking
you can use iptables to setup port style routing rules.  what are you actually trying to do and why. it seems an odd situation
I use the AWS instance as desktop. I would like when I browse not to expose my IP but I would like to be able to ssh and remote desktop to it
AWS IP - who cares ?. it's not "yours"
it's perfectly mine alright
it's not. it's part of a huge AWS CIDR block. that's assigned to them
atm???
at the moment, right now
oh,... i'm using the default player in ubuntu
i suggest mplayer with the smplayer frontend. YOU can choose different video-output techniques there, so youre able to choose the one you like the most =)
thanks,... i'll try it.
!hello|zlciai_
are you able to use the accelerated graphics?
Yes  I had to download the new drivers manually from nvidias website.
what all do i have to?.  and it seems the latest drivers for windows are horrible
its pretty easy, you need the linux-headers package installed and then just run the nvidia installer from their website in sudo.
hmmm
Well the new drivers are the only ones that support my new video card.
same here i believe but they aren't running right.  i keep getting yellow screens on higher settings
ahh sorry can't help much there I stop at 1280x1024 on mine.
i was using 1024x768!
are you using the drivers from their website?.  wht kind of card do you have?
8800 GTS 320MB
Hmm that should work ok .
correct
sudo apt-get install mailx. ?
okay, I updated to Raring, and it came with a new kernel, 3.8.0-19-generic. when I boot with the new kernel, my display is detected at the lowest resolution, my wireless and wired networking isn't working, usb devices are not working, and probably more... when I boot with the old kernel, Raring seems to work without issues.
Have you checked the additional drivers in software and updates?
what do you mean?. also comparing lsmod, only about half of the modules are being loaded compared to the older kernel version
look for software and updates in the last tab is additional drivers. When you upgrade many have to be reloaded.. nvidia drvers b43 wireless...etc
okay, is there a best way to recompile the modules against the new kernel?.  I have needed to do that when working with other distrobutions but never with ubuntu. I excpected that it would have happened automatically during the dist upgrade
Have you checked additional drivers or are you just guessing here?
should i format my harddrive and reinstall ubuntu?
it seems to me that the issue could be with usbcore driver... but i'm not knowledgeful on that... Try running a liveCD and see if it mounts there
they are, and there both correct
dunno then. check your isp? does another client work (i.e. evolution)?
ive had this client working on previous installations, it collects emails, but doesnt send them
collecting is pop3 or imap. sending is smtp. If you are getting error that username or password is not right, then sounds like isp question
ok, how do i check what my isp is and what its set to in thunderbird?
your isp would be whoever supplies your internet connection.

shit. how do I stop it?
ctrl c.  dding a 100gb filesystem takes up 100gb.  even if the fs is empty. no idea what [URL]t even us. is for

!info fvwm.  do you have Universe repo installed?
Yes.
ctrl+alt+left/right
yes, but if I scroll it switches... I don't like that...
@  im assuming you have compiz-fusion/beryl enabled?
i went back to 12.04. does this exist somewhere?
run jockey-gtk then. or the 'additional drivers' app..
the one that's in Hoary is bzflag 1.x
nivex: create a community repository. the community has it. wait...no. nivex: sorry
ok. thank you :)
it must NOT be mounted for that
how is the partitions and storage handled while using live cd then  ?
well gparted won't resize on a mounted drive, but while running from another os, the hd doesn't need to be.  if it is automounted, gparted offers you to unmount it. (cd )
hmm what do you recommend for the / part ? I ran 7gb this time. but obviously it wasnt enough :D
sudo apt-get install pastebinit && sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit.  df -h | pastebinit. give both urls here
[URL] o. 3.3 even. but 8 in total i think for /
yes, funny setup, as there is lots free in /home, I'd take a 40g for root, being lazy with boot, logs and possibly wgets/compiles inn future
:D. yea was kinda stupid
other way around (additionl parti if disk fills) is easier, if you can, backup /home, case things mess up. just >3g, so no big deal.  if itt's rather fresh install (I guess so, with home below 3 g , re-install
installer is on usb
donvito, is ubuntu installed?
she wants to keep Vista to play Sims 2.. I tried to convince her.lol. but she'll see, building her a linux box with in the next few months. lol

I heard they didnt work so well w/ sims 2

gaim cant send sms messages
which sms server (brand) do you connect to?
I live in the Netherlands sms are small text messages you can send to mobile phones.  programs like skype can send them
yes i know..but do you know what sms server your attempting to connect to? chikka ?
i mean the command rake (options) work....however sudo rake options, will raise "command not found"
locate "which rake" and see if root have access to it
which rake prints 'usr/local/bin/rake'.  however that is not the right path , that path would be /usr/local/lib/jruby-1.5.0.RC3/bin , how can i change the rake path?
check the permission of the file.  you have to do it like /usr/local/lib/jruby-1.5.0.RC3/bin/rake~ or change the env variable "path"
this sound stuff is ticking me off big time lol system has been working perfectly fine for months now it desides to crap out on me. rhythmbox

shout back if that doesn't help.
thanks, just wantd to make sure it wasn't me :). ummm, gutsy

What's wrong?
PLease dont spam the channel
Ok, now I know that is spamming.. Any reason why DVd playback is really jumpy?
turn off effects and see if it clears up
Desktop effects?. The are off.
right click desktop, go to wallpaper, last tab on right set to none and check again
Right..it's off.
what cpu and how much ram, what video card
2.4ghz p4 AtI 256mb. It seems to work with vlc.
ati can be a bit of work
No lag.
k
ah, which means take out battery for how long till it loses charge?
in Linux you should be able to blank /dev/nvram, but then you have to reconfigure your bios; if you know what you're doing that's ok though.  modprobe nvram and then cat /dev/zero > /dev/nvram, for the daring only. Or pop the battery for 5 minutes; or bridge the CMOS CLR jumper on your motherboard
er, when it's connected to a wireless network
(note you can only connect to one wireless network per wifi card)
i know you can when it's wired
then no... sorry
first world problems :P
there maybe some magic you can do in permisqious mode...
:(. ;)
there we go.  what language and keyboard setup did you pick during install?
idea?
are you using a home directory from another distro or another version of gnome?
newest release, Nvida GeForece 9600m GT. Force*. i see it in Software center?
software-sources tool -> addational drivers tab..
ty
that should suggest what to install.
i find it, ty
the Pendrivelinux site has alterantives to Unetbootin
i see so many, any advice which to choose?
or you can 'dd' the iso file straight to the usb flash..  look for one that says sugested/reccomended.. ;)
I dont know
what web server do you want to run PHP with?
its apache2.  i must change something in apache conf file ?
you shouldn't have to; you can type "sudo apt-get install php5-cgi" and it should setup apache and everything for you :)
hate the whole <shift> dealy
so change it
i have gnome alsamixer but nothing necessary appears to be muted.
if you are able to unmute or turn it up, then alsactl -store (or something similiar) you can check out the man page for alsactl for exact command, 'man alsactl'.  is it a laptop ?
yep.
. is f8 the speaker key ?. anyone know about my update problem ? why it would be resolving the update addresses to localhost or 0.0.0.0 ?
f8 is my wireless key. Fn esc is mute/unmute and Fn 1 and 2 are volume.
mine was unmuted and it took me forever to figure that one out. holding down the Fn key + the speaker key.  did that work ?
it doesnt show that option. it shows the advanced recovery screen but no options
choose the second line under your normal ubuntu line
there isnt one
hmm
the problem is getting the usb key to boot. i dont remember how i installed it on her machine but im 2000 miles away, so i just text her how to do it
bios set to usb first
apparently that isnt an option
most recent bios have that option.  f12 can give boot menu on some machines also
she keeps trying and nothing happens at all. or so she says. ive looked at the pictures and it just shows the HDD twice and a lan boot option. nothing more. its a very new machien
some bios have 2 settings for boot.  boot sequence and boot order
hat could be the issues, its quite hard to troubleshoot from a distance. is there anyway i could get into her machine before ubuntu boots, since the interent is not working on ubuntu. well then i have to hope my mom will press he right keys somehow
skype the webcam towards the pc with another laptop
i tried but the resolution is not good enough to read
lol.  you said ubuntu was corrupted, whats the part it get stuck?
no internet and i had a horrible issue with apt-get that no one could resolve on this channel
so you can still enter desktop?
yes
ubuntu version?
the latest one
your mom havent got eth cable?
i havent asked i suspect not
that would be nice to update..can you check wich wifi chipset?
no idea its a dell inspiron r15
lshw -C network
well shes not online now
her wifi worked before?
yes it was fine
broke after an update?
idk there were issues with skype. then i tried to fix netflix. which i did and hten she said the wifi icon disappeared then i tried to fix apt and i killed it
what did you do exactly to fix netflix?
the problem was i added an extra libnss. and which caused some dependancy issue. which could not be resolved so itried to delete all of the libnss. which sitll didnt fix it and it killed hthe wifi
tell her to check additional drivers section, maybe some wifi drivers to enable there. otherwise eth cable
no i didnt mean that.
better yet: SCRIPTDIR=$(dir $0) ; MYFILE=$SCRIPTDIR/file
my shell script copies a file from a relative path with respect to its path..  one sec. i'll pastie it
if you need to be able to go from a relative path to a full path: the accepted way is to change to that directory and get its location, then change back to the original dir as necessary.  cd $(dir $0); SCRIPTDIR=$PWD ; cd -
[URL]  oh sorry. i'll try your solution first
there's an error in there... s/dir/dirname/
I was trying jscal -s /dev/input/js0 but got no success.. maybe doing something wrong.. :/

i was trying the 0.7 release on hardy and got really angry with it.  so i got rid of it, and did the darn thing myself in iwconfig. note to self: never *ever* do a /etc/init.d/dbus restart
iwconfig is great is it not?
some of the packages listed at the backports-list. are marked [universe] what, does that mean? and the packages not marked? whats specific with them?
unmarked packages are probably in main, universe is free software that is community (but not canonical) supported. *Free. :P
aight. thanks.
np :)
yes
change it to a Bridged Adapter. It should make your VM's NIC look like it is just another computer in the LAN (same subnet as your host)
tried makedev-dvb.sh-script with no success. it creates the filesystem, but scan complains: main:1882: FATAL: failed to open '/dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0': 2 No such file or directory
is it actually there?.  hold on.  what kinda vid card is it?
Yeah...how?
what's it associated with?
It's an ATI driver installer.
have you tried following ATI's documentation?
screen looks like its only running 8 colors or something. some color distortion
how did you install drivers?
enabling restricted hardware drivers thing
which nvidia card?
right now i'm installing the nvidia-glx-dev package along with all its other children.  GeForce3 Ti 200
!envy. !nvidia.  which driver are you using?
using 1:1.0.9631
try the envy script
yea i been having alot of flash problems. on my ubuntu distro
just start giving your problem
say, more than 300 characters?
try it.  its 255*
Isn't that just a VNC connection, though?
you will havea 'full' control over that another maching using teamviwer. but teamviwer needs a good upload speed on both machine
is it worth setting the backports-staging then?
read all the way up, it says "no, backports arent for breezy"
try, sudo apt-get install alien
k ty i will try it.  nice tyvm
how do i do that?
window > notify list
I am not sure Kerin, I think I am still using the beta. I have Hardy
Open Firefox, click Help menu > About. what version does it display there?
nevermind... I just checked, and it is version 3 . I remember I had an update about 10 minutes before it was supposed to come out
good show. glad it's set up right!
yaboot?. where is it install ur home dir. ?
i dont understand your question
yeah what is it?. is there any scripts in the dir
nothing in the main dir
Waste of time putting them in two diff packages.. tx
you may find one is a metapackage
thing is that right now it gave me the same ip that my windows boot is using, does it assign a specific ip to a specific mac adress or soemthing?
na i think dhcp will ping the ip everynow and then and if it doesnt reply it will release it so you can use it again. is your windows dual boot or another machine completely?
how long does it hold it for? and yep, for now, trying to migrate to ubuntu for sound, just taking a while to get it all going..wierd on the dhcp thing, i dont want to be without a conncetion for another 2 days:P
simple solution would be to statically assign IP's. outside of the dhcp pool
System is running. CD still needed?
So you have a usable system at the moment then?
any pointers?
sorry never used it, maybe #bash is a good place for that
and how would i fix that?
install them manually
...how?
try your ./configure and look at the errors you get.  they will suggest what is missing
but it must be broken on my comp. it wont let me get build-deps for any package
I see. it sounds odd
sort of.. I used to have breezy, then dist-upgraded to dapper. but because of instability I re-installed clean, and kept my home folder.
the only problem w/ doing that is you carry over all the old configs which might not be right. If instead you move your old home dir to a new directory name before you install, then your user will be created with the right config files in the home dir and you can copy over your data (non .files) from your old home dir
I didn't want to do that, since I would loost all of my customisations / settings from apps. I thought it would be ok, since I was using dapper anyway.
dunno, but I had that same thing happen to me. and it was solved by making a new admin user, then using that admin user to remove my user (after moving the non-config files) then recreating my user and moving my files back
hrm. I gues I'll have to do that.
you can always try moving over the important configs (firefox etc).  as those are probably fine
yeah, and evolution
yep
Will it mess with me being able to switch layouts with the keyboard preferences editor?
it didn't for me, no.
Thanks
"-mtime ..." might be what you need as the test, then followed by a move, e.g: "find /path/to/source -mtime 3 -exec mv {} /path/to/destination/ \;"
no idea what to do.  not familiar with .bash_profile stuff
I think ~/.bash_profile is where it wouldgo. I use Firewall Builder, pretty good too..  open a terminal and open ~/.bash_profile

that'd explain it. linux thinks your clock is set to UTC. so adjusts. which ones is correct?. linux?
well at least the are getting recognized, you may have some key sequence or something to enable them idk
ok, cool, thank you
have you checked system settings/display and see if they show up there
yes, they don't. I read somewhere that people where having problems getting screens recognized with this laptop, just can't remember where. Could it have to do with the fact I'm using nouveau drivers instead of nvidia?
could be idk...just throwing out suggestions
sure, thanks. I'm trying to get support in the nvidia channel now, we'll see if they can help

I have VLC installed but dunno how to enable vdpau in it
so you get the same error?
I'm not sure how to name the components... the this is yesterday when I mounted the volumes they were added on the Desktop and search menu for instance
gconf-editor->apps->nautilus->computer_icon_visible
when but that would show only the computer icon on the desktop. Not the /media/Windows and /media/Storage being the two mounted volumes
gconf-editor->apps->nautilus->volumes_visible
well there is already a check mark :(
you can also make links to /media/Windows.  etc, ...  I guess volumes only mean removable storage in this case
this seems to be so simple and easy I can't find it on the forums
I've done it right now: on the desktop, select the menu "create new launcher".  Select as "Type": Link.  Give it a nice name at "Name"
yeah i looked at at bashing-om

oh well at least ya got it running, is it any different than beryl? ive got compiz on this now but id like beryl, i see its much better at visual movement
I have beryl on a gentoo box, but its an nvidia card so I don't know how much that accounts for a difference. It seems like beryl is easier to administer though
does it look like compiz? as far as the visuals go? or is it much better. I'd like to put beryl as a separate session
its basically the same: a cube, wobbly windows, etc.
I setup an adhoc network with static ip's using ubuntu, but i suffer 1000+ ping between machines

how long were you using gnome?. I tried out kde on fedora 9 for a few days but then school started.... how did you install it using gnome? just download the deb and let ubuntu do the rest?
I have both installed, I like kde and my wife is still on gnome
i heard about it but they say it will only work on the edgy version...will it work on 7.10 too?
i guess so... try it
window borders. buttons
run "metacity"
drag and drop
see if right clicking the file gives you the 'sent to->bluetooth' option

install "alacarte" and create a new menu entry that points to the newer one
yes but isnt there also a linux program to change the suid like setsuid which sounds like it also does the same thing as chmod setting those bits?
not sure, i dont think so
i think it is something like this [URL] [URL]
that's what you use inside the program to set the uid.  like setuid(0); to set the program's privileges to root and then write whatever code after that
oh geez thats all
unless you want to give more details as to the problem... ;)

Hm, so I should try chmod on /media/mydrivename?
fstab is only required for permissions when you use FAT/NTFS (none native filesystems)
I see. Going to try chmod now..  I see that my ext4 drive is owned by root in /media. Another random USB drive I plug in (FAT32) is owned by my user.
if it's ext4 - change the owner then.

reiso: that's the problem... the error message flashes too fast to capture and then the screen gets "lines" across it
lines?
yup. almost like the graphics card is failing/ driver issue... except it works just fine before a reboot. i'm dual booting (on a laptop) with windows 7. reiso: it's weird. it's done this twice... but the install went just fine otherwise
if you type 'rei' then hit TAB, what happens?
when i try to upgrade i get failed to fetch error, i'm working to duplicate the problem now.  you there
hi. sorry bathroom break
hi.  any luck with that error code
sorry you were the one getting error during reinstall?. when does the error occur
how did I end having so many users? [URL] 3 roots??
they each have one domain, eg root@localhost, root@anydomain. So you've done a setup, added phpmyadmin and owncloud. So it's right

ask them to provied you with a proper key then
nilesh, the program in the administration menu..
- sorry but i dint that?.  - sorry but i dint get that?
nilesh?... ubuntu menu > system > administration > live usb install
ohh this way
yes. i made a bootable usb but i cant boot from it
- [URL]  - try about link.
9.10.  it said 8.10+ on the downloader, I figured it to mean 8.10 and later
oh, ok
i could be wrong though, i don't think there's a specific release for 9.10
mine gt corrupt every few months or so
I don't have it... I have a load of other fstypes, but not vfat
dosfstools
did that... it's not picking it up for some strange reason.. well, ~/.mozilla/plugins and /usr/lib/flash-addons/plugins. Didn't try yours. Moment then.
what about other browser? like Opera? not trying to push you to it, just wondering if it's a chrome setting, rather than not reading it
oh, how?
forward the port to your computer inside your router.  forward the port to your computer inside your router
I got disconnected (again, damn it) - lost your messages - maybe I'll try again with my initial problem - my sister's pc connects via wifi just fine, but not with the cable - any suggestions?. sec...
maybe the dhcp configuration doesn't work on the ethernet interface
this is my dhcp config, sorry for it being pdf, but I had troubles making it an image - [URL]  the pc in question is the one - 192.16.1.14
Okay. Configuration looks good. I think it's some issue with the pc of your sister
but... it worked well with Windows.... let me reconnect all the cables and switches
Maybe it's a simple problem with the cabling, yes. Inside the web interfaces of most routers you can see when there is a successful ethernet link
no, resetted everything :(. to no avail :(. that is making me crazy
does the network card have a link?
I have heard this question before, I would love to just give an access to this pc to someone, like you, just don't know how?
her pc runs ubuntu?
i foudn it in the synap manager.
dpkg -L <package> |grep bin
nothing
pastebin the script
doing a quick search, seems 7000m shouldn't be over 83c when overclocked & full load, so that's definitely a problem... if it's a passive heatsink, it's probably a bad mating... if it's an active heatsink, the fan is dead and/or it's a bad mating...
is that a simple fix? or do i need a new gpu?.  sorry this is my first laptop.. havent played inside them ever.
[URL] <--- take a look at the service manual... you might be able to put some new thermal compound on the existing gpu heatsink and fix your problem
awesome! tyvm for your help. very much appreciated!
there is a CPU thermal module (aka fan)... bet that fan is dead... the service manual has the exact part #, so you can find it on ebay or something...
ty again will definitely check it out.
lol, sorry... no gpu fan, but I'm sure you'll find what is or isn't working with that service manual ;)
i hope tyvm. i did however already find missing and incorrect parts to the manual lol
i dont want esd, i dont use gnome.  besides, why would vim need it
i dont know. just spraying an idea :)
thanks, i'll try! If i recall correctly, that fixed wayland issues on my nvidia box about a year ago (fedora)
because nvidia blob wants eglstreams, and a year ago nothing supported that. gnomes mutter apparently supports it now tho, but no other compositor I know of.  as per usual a case of nvidia being nvidia
nomodeset seems to have worked, not verified whether wayland is active but those artifacts are gone now ...thanks again
:)
ok... well my ultimate goal is to copy the folder & contents of ~/.config/deluge to /var/lib/deluge/.config/deluge and change read/write access permission for the copied file to the deluge user. What specific commands should I enter to do this?
if the permissions are already set correctly for ~/.config/deluge then using the -p flag for cp will preserve the. *them. so cp -pvR ~/.config/deluge/* /var/lib/deluge/.config/deluge/.  the -v is for verbose and -R is for recursive
right ok but would that include directories name .*
aye -- if you do echo .* you should see it globbed
well on the output it has been saying ./.Trash/[URL]le, is it still ignoring those?
maybe --exclude=.* ??
i will try it, thanks.  very good its working1
:)
what is smart actually? a chip resides on the mobo or the hard disk?. though -d option is usable. but seems can't figure out which one is right
sorry seems it works, [URL]
hmm maybe. Sonetimes it can't be seen unless you have something in it.  though if you have only one DVD drive what the hell is USB CD than?
I think I just ignored it because it has a long name. I think USB CD is boot from USB?
not sure. In general it's called USB volume and visible when usb is plugged in.  anyway, if your DVD is higher priority that HDD/SSD it should skip empty drives and try to load from next on in list
My DVD drive is ATAPI CD0 HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GUC0N . It wasn't at the top
it should be gigher that HDD / SSD.  *higher.  but it can be not the 1st one
Now I've changed it.  Why not?
loading just goes that way: check 1st drive. If exits - load.  if nothing in - go to 2nd in list.  so if you have only DVD in, it will anyway come to it
But I've just set it to be first?
ahh ok. just set first) it will be easier)
Ok. I wonder if I can leave quick boot on
just read later how it checks bootable devices. And how boot order works.  you can.  it's about testing.  and skipping some system tests.  you may have turn on legacy mode
I left quick boot on
is it possible to do it with ubuntu-server as well ?
probably, but i am unsure as to the package name.  apt-cache search ubuntu-server
is the hashing still weak ? can it be attacked ?
Not sure what the default hash is now, but no matter how long it is, I wouldn't bet on it never being cracked
ok, those two are the first things i coudl think of, anything from top of your heads that could be important in /etc/* ?
Anything not world readable. Some config files contain passwords too
Mattj 7.10.  can you give me link to howto aboit configure it?
CUPS is certainly installed by default, what are you trying to do?
well.. i need to share printer over local network
See the links from ubotu
yeah I've seen that tool before, but as you said, it's really messy configure.  I wonder if someone made something easier...
not that I've seen.
are you sure that that would not provoke conflicts if they are running the same kind of services?
i am positive.
if you have a reference to documentation for that, i buy you a pizza.
lets start with the basics. do you understand what avahi is for ?
yes. i do. i just need to know if the avahi-dns-daemon part will provoke conflict, as it sounded like it was keeping a cache and functioning as name resolver. whch could get kinda funky if there's like... thre of them
it only announces it's own hostname as a CNAME
i see. thank you very much for your help :)
actually it only announces its own hostname > ip as a CNAME after it hears a request for that hostname as a mulitcast queries.  no problems.
even if its serving services like dlna and things?
yes, it also announces services the host machine provides as TXT records.  you can see this info on your local network with avahi-discover
woa, that's convenient. thanks!
seriously, avahi is awesome
I've just recently installed XGl.. but that's not x
Oh, if you're running xgl, I can't help you, sorry.
. I don't know of another editor that does some of the stuff Sweep does. :(
when the most recent version came out in 2008 i repeat, "time to find a more modern editor" sorry man I don't have any real suggestions - hope you find a solution.
installed it via apt-get & synaptic.. either way I see it in /usr/X11R6/bin but unable to launch it
you can launch it as /usr/X11R6/bin/xvkbd , or you can add /usr/X11R6/bin to your path, or you can create a symlink to that and then place the symlink somewhere in your path
ok. but what command should I use
fsck /dev/sdXY where X is a letter based on the disk (a for first, b for second, c for third) and Y is a number based on partiton (1, 2, 3 etc)
does it have a server version?
yes, the nonfree Virtualbox supports remote viewing via vnc
ok, sounds good, thanks
its not comparible to vmware esx if thats what you mean by server version
no, for use on a server running ubuntu. Like KVM, but this machine doesn't have hardware support
ah like so, then yeah virtualbox is the easiest\
yeah, it sounds like the right solution... I just didn't think of it because I've only used it as a desktop solution befure. before*
you can start it in headless mode or remotely(sortof) over ssh -X
thanks seveas. seveas, it says i386. does that mean 32-bit
yup
dammit. do i have to reinstall to get 64-bit?
yup
but not with the same live cd?
correct
or do i do something different while installing?
you need a 64bit livecd
How do i make apt-get/synaptic ignore a package, so it doesn't update? do i use filters?
I've answered that. What's the problem?
thanks
rm -ri sorry.  that is going to ask if you want to delete every single file, since rm -r is not a particuarly safe command.  if you're sure what you're doing just do rm -r
it sends me back to the authentication screen with (logged in) next to my username. after I (re)authenticate it takes me back to the empty desktop :S
oooo
that's a lot of vowels!
ok do ctrl+a;t+F1 again log in then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ...when that is finished sudo restart gdm if anything installed
dont know, i think they should
awesome
ok ill check.  ok it wasnt installed also php5-cgi isnt installed should i install it. n/m
That all depends on what you are hoping to achieve. I am still working under the presumption that you are attempting to access your own server (localhost). It will depend on what php-cgi provides..  ah, ok, you figured it out. cheers!
ok!
although, I personally use the ~/.bin that cafuego mentioned :)
thanks . . . do ssd really last longer do you know?
longer than a hard drive? it would depend on how you you it I would suppose.  If all you do is read from it, it should last forever
oh so it would be better for one time backups then.  not really a file server
well, its not really "cheap" enough for backups... its usual purpose are low power or small form factor devices
like a root directory on a file server
its not really appropriate at all for a desktop or server.  I suppose, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense... just put a hard drive in
A cross-platform solution would be nice.
oh then that's perfect for you fai
Nvidia 9700M GTS. according to the manufacturer site of the notebooks, it says 2048x1200 something. but I really want to know if it can handle 1440p
2048x1536 even? what output types does it have, VGA? HDMI?
zmaslfasnlf, not sure what you mean by backports but they should be available through additional drivers. not sure, let me check. notebook does have an hdmi output.  max. resolution : 2,048 x 1,536. max. refresh rate : 85 Hz. non-interlaced resolution with max. refresh rate : 1,280 x 1,024. from [URL] is there a command in ubuntu to find out? i tried xrandr but it give only res
yeah so that's a VGA res, not hugely relevant if you're going to use a digital output..  so apparently you have HDMI on there?
9.10 wasn't bad, but i had some issues with it, which are fixed in 10.04.
like what?
the main one that anoyed me was that it would never keep my screen resolution when i restarted. also, KDE feels much faster.
I never had the resolution problem.. speed was great on 9.10 until this last kernel upgrade then it just tanked
if i open a wma it plays fine. but if i got to a website that is streaming a wma it wouldnt play
can you stream other files like oggs
I dont know what oggs are. but i can stream the videos on you tube.
does this stream [URL]
that plays
the problem could be windows drm which is something which isn't fixable to my knowledge
so i can watch wma but not stream?
well you have a couple types of wma some are DRM some arn't
they are empty
Be patient... or check #compiz-fusion...
read the manpage for more information on the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc. and /etc/profile also
man bash?
i have. user's $home/.dmrc file is being ignred this prevents the default session and language from being saved. file should be owned by user and have644 permissions. users $home directory must be owned by user and not wriable by other users. is what it says when i try to log on. it doesnt work. only command line works
did you mess around with user permissions ?
might be, going to check that, did not want to download the whole server list. tx so much
at least they might be able to help, its backtrack's channel
ok in unetbootin there is a button with ... on it,, click that , click the iso image,, and click ok,,.  or double click the iso image so that unetbootin will grab it.  but click that one button with the three dots on it to locate the iso file , then double click the iso file name and it should load in unetbootin
unebootin is asking me for location of disk image
right,, so when you click that button with three dots on it, a file window opens ,, locate the iso image with that
ok i got it...its loading now
click "Computer" in the left pain,, then in the right click the icon there and it should open the home directory.  if you downloaded the image to your desktop then click on home,, then click on Desktop
I got it  its doing something'
cool
its not fitting in 1gb USBStick
when it finishes it will ask if you want to reboot,, say yes and test it,, make sure that the bios allows for booting from usb
its not fitting in that 1gb
I believe austrumiu is far less than 1gig.  do you have other stuff on that flash drive?
yes
well you need a a blank flash drive for this to work.  remove what is on there and try again
its done and asking me to reboot the entire computer.  I thought its going to format and wipe my USB drive and install
amazon has one coming out called workstations. backdoor is a difficult term to swallow
Is it open source?
its more like all of their traffic is sniffed. yeah i've learned to love the b-bomb long time ago. asana was the softwar eiw as thinking of
Thanks, I'll take a look at asana... maybe it's the cure
/usr/bin/unison -batch 11-13-Documents > /home//LOG.  the file was created, but is empty
also add 2>&1.  what does unison do anyways? if its editing a file, then most likely you will not get an output
ments > /home//LOG 2>$1 ? where will it output the log? also, unison is basically like rsync, and it does output when run as ./test.sh
it will spit it out to your /home//LOG both stdout and stderr
how
right click on the file and I think from memory you go into permissions and check the box named execute
Huh. I am connected via IPv6.
IPv6 what country are you in?
USA. I am stoned and I could be wrong.. But I have an "inet6 addr".
then you don't need ipv6
I know, but I am connected via IPv6.. I'd rather use v4.. But I don't even know what I did here.
you you dont see inet addr:192.168.x.x ?. Why isn't avahi advertising my ssh server?
Negatory.
what does sudo iwconfig say?
So, I guess I'm not actually connected then.
I dunno send me a dpaste of the output of ifconfig
That would sound great but I'm not connected to the Internet.. No USB drives.. Wait, what the fuck?. I guess I am connected.. But to "".
when you type iwconfig it should say ESSID:"your network name" ### if it doesn't then your wireless isnt associated
It does. It says 'ESSID:""'.. "Link Quality=10/100".
ESSID what? tell me what the essid is.
"".
your not associated with your wireless ap then.  re associate and see what happens
I know, and I tried to associate with it.
are you using wep or wpa?
WPA.
and you typed in the right password and all
.Oh my goodness! It connected.. I don't know what you did but it worked. Thanks .
your welcome, when your having trouble connecting, just try and reconnect and that will fix %90 of all problems.. Why isn't avahi advertising my ssh server?
no you all didnt. i still have the problem
something is probably wrong with the drive then if you cant mount it
i use xp-pen
never heard of it but if "xp" = windows XP, expect unforeseen consequences
it's detected as UC-Logic Technology Corp. on "lsusb".  how to use it?
http://www.xp-[URL] is their website. no linux support mentioned that I can see..  you could try installing windows drivers in Wine. Or install windows to virtualbox and run it from there.
okay, i'll try it.  thank's
happy2helpp. !ufw|vael__
oh? hmmm. it might take me out of x right there and then eh?
yes, that may happen... so be prepared :)
CTRL + C.  When you CTRL + C, does it say anything like: 100% packet loss?
it shows 147 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 146047ms. ya
Okay, we're close to solving your problem. We're probably going to have to change your DNS server to a much better one.
what is the server
System -> Administration -> Network
then.  r u getting me
sorry i mean the one you download in synaptic, and the xfree86 binary thing
which xfree86 binary thing? fglrx from synaptic is the same driver as you can download from ATI's website.
alf-f2?!
alt-f2 is used to run programs. launch*
not sure I understand that
in a terminal type "which httpd" and it may print out the full path to your httpd binary
er.. I need to do this as part of a script. any idea what cli way?. google got me to ~/.config/autostart except what goes in there is daunting
add it to ~/.config/autostart as a .desktop file
I'm hoping for dapper
Best bet is to wait a fortnight, then.
<unconvertable>  thanks. i am trying to figure out why my /home partition is 90% used... /home is 40GB. I have files for only 15GB. But it shows i have used 35.7GB. Why this happens?
aww poo, it won't let me assign the blue Access IBM character to anything.. heh. key, not character..
shouldn't it be 2x 2.20ghz. ok thanks, i thought i got ripped off. hhahaha. thanx guys
it could be that speedstep is in use.  speedstep lowers CPU speed when idle
php gd.  i dunno
apt-get install php5-gd
tehdgm can you have 2 extended on 1 drive?
holy crap user spam.  you dont need to, as you can have virtually unlimited paritions inside your extended
tehdgm can they all be primary? :P
they're "logical". But you can install an OS on them no problem. You might need to have your boot on a primary though
tehdgm just a few more questions and i should be well on my way :) is swap primary?
you can have your swap inside an extended just fine as far as i know. I think that is actually what i have on my main system.  you can even have multiple swap partitions on multiple discs
tehdgm yeah thats how i had it with what is now sda5/6. they were the only 2 in extended. sda4 was shrunk off of win7 at a later date and i split the swap in half that was in extended to share it between the 2 ubuntu partitions. tehdgm at first i tried without splitting the swap and (of course) hibernate would be lost when booting into the other OS.
ah i dont know i never use hibernate
dude what kind of drive is it?. malsid?
Yeah?
it's not set to autohide
Then enable it, and the panel will disappear, giving the entire desktop.
it's server OS, no gui
VNC is GUI only... you can't remote control a CLI install ;)
i am using 2 OS on 2 seperate harddrive now, one is windows xp, the other is ubuntu
what about swap? this isn't System V, your swap isn't going to fill up.. if you're worried about swap getting in the way of other things just tack it on before the ubuntu paritions or after them
how do i mount up my windows xp harddrive on my ubuntu desktop everytime i start up my computer
[URL]
is there a commandline to do it everytime i start up my computer automatically?
just follow the instructions in that link and it'll come up on login
hi but i did not see the link u posted, can u please post it again ?
Sure! [URL]
tedd what exactly is the problem?
Well. I get this error instlaling. "Debootstrap failed something or other". It's infamous on the forums. There was one solution but I didn't understand it; maybe you can explain it to me. Something about using "format as the method"; Ubuntu wants to format for itself even if it already is
can you point me to the page?
Absenth gave me the link; I don't think I can dig it up but I can point you to one. Hold on
are you installing along side windows or what?
Stand-alone.. I erased the entire thing.
:/ the purpose of this was to be able to do it quickly. Do I really have to log out and log in?
heh. xcept on my system, there's not much point until I upgrade to a CPU _with_ the VT extensions.... Mine's just a Pentium Dual Core. Not even a Core/2 Duo.
Sonera (finland)
do they provide online storage space?
musictracker
i think there's a package called pidgin-plugins... however that's on gutsy, which would be released today
i am using gutsy.  it doesn't have this plugin
download the source and compile
tried . says can't find pidgin
did you do apt-get build-dep pidgin ?
Messer: the python.... held back
Ah, sudo aptitude dist-upgrade.  It has some conflicting packages. That fixes it
!info screen.  it's a virtual tty that lets you have more than one screen, and you can detach/reattach at will, on a tty or via ssh/etc
I'm launching lubuntu w/o a DE so I'm only running in tty1
no
which runs Palm OS.
I presume they aren't on the palm
nermal, huh? on my pda, my memos have categories.
Thanks kll but it still doesnt explain which is better. Basically I have two drives at 1TB they will store movies, pictures and music.. Which option would be best to mirror the other?
mirror? for speed improvment or for backup? because backup doesnt work that way
I suppose a backup of sorts but I would be backing up to a USB drive also.
neither of them both are meant for backup.
I would just like the safety if one hard drive were to fail I would have the data on the other.. And its easy to get the data off the other.
so you will be better with a singel hdd with a backup script that copies the data to the other one
So why not Greyhole or Raid 1 K1l?
its not a backup.  if you delete a file its still gone.
But if I delete a file then I dont want it anyway?
so ok. if you already choosen raid1 or greyhole then go for it.
No I haven't. I'm just curious with your answer.
[URL]
i should install one :)
planetpenguin-racer - goofy fun, and a good test of 3d
with the path or without?
try both, see what it is opening....  i have to run.... bbl
hey, thanks!
or lower case L.. not sure
wish it was that easy!
I've always found it to be.  Of course, adding the right ip/host combo to /etc/apache2/[URL]nf helps.
that in /var/log?
Yes.
doesnt appear to exist either
What logs fo you have? grep ppt /var/log/*
you know how to get around it?
steal someone else's cookie.  use linux or macosx
I use linux, but i want to stop fighting with it in windows.  i've tried spoofing my MAC to be somebody elses :).  you go to DSU?
no
thanks
or the other way round
how do I do it
what is the problem exactly
with wine, trying to use any app. it cuts out all other sound
ah yes
and then when I re open any other app, sound goes to the other apps and not the app with wine (ventrilo)
no idea, try using the wine ppa maybe it wokrs better
Hahaha yeah man, yay for outsourcing jobs.
yep
Those Dell commercials showing the nice, attractive, and young mid-20s female are so full of bullshit it makes my blood boil.. Not being racist here, but it's the truth.
lol yah
/etc/apache2 contains only directories .. no files
sudo apt-get autoclean and autoremove?
either is fine... when I run dpkg --remove I'm prompted to reinstall the package first
dpkg --purge ?
Fryguy: I did. Was it too long?
i've been here 14 hours, so hurry up
(11:25:52 AM)  I've got a CD which contains both executables and CD audio. When prompted, out of curiosity, I decided to play it as a CD to see what the audio was like; now, I can't seem to get the system to read it as a game CD anymore. How do I fix that?
just go to "computer" in nautilus and explore the disc manually
Fryguy: Oddly enough, I can't seem to get it to cooperate in that regard, or I wouldn't ask.. Fryguy: Unless Nautilus is the command line. (n00b.) If so, I haven't tried that.
it's not.  it's the standard file explorer uses.  i don't use it, and i haven't run into the problem, so I don't really have any other advice for you, sorry
in a directory
*so long as it also came with a .bin
I will check that out and maybe fluxbox....
what features are you after?
I like gnome, been on it for two years, but I want something with good features but is lightweight, maybe I will try xfce for a while
I have tried xfwm inside gnome...I like this setup. I do not like metacity at all.  If you like gnome, then I wouldn't use sawfish by itself
u use that instead of GDM?
I don't use gdm
sawfish looks like early gnome!
it was, then gnome changed to metacity...wrong move in my opinion
10.10, yet the upgrade to 10.10 failed and it did a roll back. is lsb release -a the guaranteed version I'm at?. or is it just some indicating file somewhere?
not sure to be honest. I would assume a file.
sure
look at wifi-tools or there is a network manager you can install for gnome
I'm not showing a wifi-tools package, do you know the name of the GNOME manager?
it might be network-manager
the gnome network-manager doesn't support wifi networks
[URL]
No, not already backed up. I would plan on booting from a live cd and transfering to an external drive
But why is it not already backed up now?
I didn't know I was supposed to back it up regularly.. Nor did I know how.
if your drive motor fails and the drive doesn't spin up, where is your data?.  if you can copy data to a USB drive, you can backup
Well it doesn't have anything that important, I just don't want to have to setup apache and etc again.
you can mount the wubi image from the ubuntu live CD.
So, just going in and copying it all and then pasting on a fresh install will restore everything?
I suggest you REGULARLY backup your data, then you wouldn't have this situation.
what do you mean by "site manager"? is it a setting in filezilla?
File >> Site Manager.  Create a new site connection profile to the FTP/SFTP you're trying to connect to..  Just be sure to change the servertype to SFTP.
why can't I get it off the CD then?
you using the server/alternate install cd?
using alternate. Should I try live?
do you have networking setup and the internet working?
I didnt get network working. Is that important?
well if you had networking setup it may be getting that of the internet, or it may allow you to download one during install
I think it's a hardware thing, and the installer cant find my network device. Any other way?
perhaps the live cd may be easier, but you could potentially download this file off the internet and copy it to that computer
is it possible to install it on a flash?
well it seems like just the kernel package is messed up, you could potentially just copy this over to the computer running the install but it might be too much bother if you don't know what you are doing, your cd may have problems or your cd drive
I've checked both CD, md5 and memory. Still possible it's a hardware thing? The compy is pretty new.
well it occasionally happens with me, it can depend on the burning speed etc so the md5 may be right but it reads different sometimes
yes....
what was the outcome?
the first time I attempted the install, it worked, but the partitioning tool failed with error code ten, so I uninstall, and tried a reinstall.  mmk, thanks
if that doesn't work, cat /casper.log at the initramfs prompt, shift page up and look for errors

virtio drivers to run Windows guests under KVM hypvervisor?. drivers for a Windows OS?
seems I don't have a kernel installed. what I'm trying to do is see if I have the devel package installed for a kernel
the kernel packages start with "linux-image-".  the headers are linux-headers-generic or linux-headers-$(uname -r)
i tired them all, the only thing that makes any sound at all is "automatic" but it just crackles
Not insulting intelligence, but when I have problems I re-insert the physical connections and check the wires.
actually OSS makes a loud beeping sound.  but how can i figure out and fix whatever is wrong with alsa?
also did you install anything recently. I've had programs trash out sound configuration.
only thing i've been working on tonight is getting my svideo out to the tv working, which required me to uninstall and reinstall a bunch of fglrx stuff a few times, and restore some default config files, is it possible that it's something in [URL]nf?
one other thing. Right-click the sound icon on the task bar. And in volume control and preferences make sure the right channel is selected.
i think the right channel was selected but either way it makes the crackling sound with any playback channel
I'm not sure. Here's a link to troubleshooting: [URL]
right!. more research XD
so: how do I do that?
i'll see if i can figure that out for you standby
I thought you guys know... ;-)
it's already been done?
GNOME 2.28 is set to use WebKit quite a bit
thanks
that sets it for that command; otherwise 'export KERNEL_PATH=/foo/bar. '
build essentual is installed
how about the rest of the instructions ?
there was no dependencies and no i ran make after i was in the file
you need to run ./configure first
Ah - no wonder I couldn't find them :).  Thanks.
aptitude search is your friend, it searchs (including substrings) on package names
I was using synaptic
I think synaptic will do the same
how are you checking it? i can boot a 14.04 VM with 3.19 and compare
could it be due to this commit? [URL] ?.  sysctl kernel.shmmax; sysctl kernel.shmall; ipcs -lm
LOL.  So you really don't have an answer?
I lookd but cant seem to find any place where its storing that information
... hum... ah, but i've already talked with you... i remember..
when was that?
... too hard to remember. but i know that i've already spoke with you
I'm pretty sure I said the same thing back then. So why aren't you believing me?
just wait for a check
pardon?
that only lists the folders, not what's in them
ls -lAhR.  man ls
the install file simply told me to make after ./configuring
have you checked if there is a makefile now? try./configure again
: well I think they are, because thy are on my Debian Sid box
hm.  and the versions? :)
good question... do you mean they are newer on Hoary and not yet translated ?
they might be newer on sid. and older on hoary, yhes
cdrom. @ cdrom
and /dev/sr* are links to /dev/cdr* correct
negative, cdrom0 and cdrom1 are links to sr*. this is a fresh install, btw, I've not played with it at all
thought i said that, must have misprinted.  said it backwards but so far things are good
right....I didn't want to change the permissions because I figured that was on purpose.. I'm even part of the cdrom group as my user
is /usr/bin/totem a link to /etc/alternatives/totem*
well, apt then. sorry
man apt-get. it has options for that
can you guild me please?
i installed it from the plf repositories, but i believe it's in canonical commercial too
Hi there mate...I only installed Ubuntu today...is there a wiki on making it an executable?
Right click it, Properties > Permissions > Tick Allow executing file as program.
sweeet. thanks mate
then just double click it, and click Run in terminal :)
i tried lock package but it didnt work
- but I honestly dont recall how. I just remember I did that once back circa 2002
I just did a dist-upgrade and X starts with a grey screen and a cursor but no window manager starts
are you using gnome?
fvwm
are you on another computer now?
No I'm in a virtual console using irssi
ok. the way to do it for now is to type (from a virtual console) "xterm --display :0". then go to the display.  and type fvwm-session
It says it can't open because DISPLAY is not set
oops, xterm -display :0.  anything?
One sec.  I got the xterm...but fvwm-session doesn't exist
i don't have fvwm, but try pressing fvwm[tab] and tell me which programs you see.  might wanna try just 'fvwm'
A lot....fvwm, fvwm2, fvwm-config, fvwm-root....some more
try fvwm2-session.  or just fvwm / fvwm2
No fvwm2-session, just fvwm2
try that
It says another WM is running and to try -replace.  when i try fvwm -replace X dies
do you have any wm's running?
Not that I can see...It just looks like X with a white arrow cursor and a grey background...nothing else
try (from virtual terminal) 'sudo killall X & sudo killall gdm'.  then from virtual terminal try "X :0 & xterm -display :0 & fvwm2".  have you tried doing just a 'startx'?
No processes killed.  Doing startx is how I got X in the first place, otherwise there is just console
try "X :0 & xterm -display :0 & fvwm2". oops.  skip the &fvwm part, put that in xterm.  pretty much same as before, but with a fresh X
Worked! :-D
good
yes using .run file. how i remove that
maybe the is a deinstaller in the run-script
how i dont know kindly tell me
call the runfile with --help
how can i upgrade flash ? (i am new to Ubuntu)
well if u want the simplest solution to try and see if it's either the video driver or flash.. try googlechrome(has flash builtin).. if u get the same symptom with googlechrome, then u should try seeing if u using the proper videodriver
i know but i want more :-P
electricsheep ?
I'm wrong or the page is?
trying to find the tech specs page now...
: same problem for you?
don't know - havent gotten that far yet. but if i do end up with a problem, I'd like to know how to fix it, hehe
: can you try to burn a dvd with k3b and let me know the results?
no disks with me (@work)
where's this volume control?
i dunno..mine is on my taskbar beside my clock and load meters...
well mine apperently isnt =(.  no it isnt muted
right click an empty spot on your taskbar, click "add to panel" and it'll bring up a little menu of mini apps to put on your taskbar..select the volume control one. have it plugged into the right hole?
there is only one card there that supports a mic, and it is not muted
then i say again..is the mic plugged into the right port?
no, should it?:).  #wine-hq doesn't exist..
#winehq ?
HoN is native.
do you run it with the exta command to make it use the nvidia gpu?
Yes.
have you tried it without?.  have you tried in a different session, like xfce etc?
[URL]
try install xfce4, reboot then log into the xfce session. Is it better?
I'm in Blackbox now. No difference.
all I can suggest is report a bug. I have seen few success stories with switching GPU
It used to work fine.
there is a present bug though. right?
HoN works fine without bumblebee..  Yes, so?
it should be reported then
yeah it says they been hold back, but why did that happen?
upgrading them probably needs extra packages, try apt-get dist-upgrade
but this ubuntu, not BSD
yeah
k, give me 120 seconds.  alright go
go what
I'm using XBMC on Ubuntu and I want XBMC to be able to recognize my media (TV Shows) a little better. There are third party apps that will do this on Windows, I'm wondering what Ubuntu users should use.
cant say that ive ever noticed any. I rarely use xbmc except to try it out every so often. The tool just has to many odd quirks. ;)
So you just use MPlayer. Man, you are missing out.
i tend to use vlc. I really dont like the interface to xbmc. or some of the quirks it has. I do try it agaion about every 3 months..  installing xbmc right now on the wifes windows box. But she also tends to just use vlc. !info moovida. moovida is a similer to xbmc app also. :) not quite as fancy
I cant see the applet.. I am running xfce
is network manager installed?
umm I am not sure.. how do I tell ?
try "locate network-manager" at the command line and see if you get any files
basically I have just installed xfce cos I hated the new gnome and unity.. and gnome classic is just not supported.. so I went for xfce but now I don't have any of the applets etc.  yeah I get plenty of files from that command
there is a configuration file /etc/init/network-[URL]nf, if that is not installed edit /etc/network/interfaces
yeah.  but with me using xfce.. should I uninstall this and install a xfce applet?
not used xfce so not sure
dunno, it's more a server question, I want to know what would be the best place to put thoses. I'm thinking /usr/share/php/zf and /usr/share/php/doctrine with subfolder for each version... and set everything readonly... but I'm not sure if I should place those in that folder ?
So, #ubuntu-server is more suitable for that.
thanks . no joy getting mouse to work. can u offer advice?
probably now.. PS2 mouse? usb?
USB wireless mouse, has just stopped responding..worked fine before hand
reattach it? positive the mouse is talking to the receiver?
AH  just reattatched mouse to different port and its come back on
cool
I'm asking because it's actually not a device known to the system it's not listed in interfaces and iwconfig doesn't see it. I don't know how to "enable" it
looks like an atheros wlan card. i think you need to install restricted modules to get the drivers.
is there a restricted modules for ubuntu server?. I can't find one for linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-25-server
no idea. driver is available at [URL] if you wish to compile it yourself.
- yes, i do. Through my router
Try connecting your computer directly to the internet.  If you are able to connect via LAN, it seems like a router mis-configuration
- can't. i have a combined router/modem.  - well, i did exactly as when i configured my ssh, and that worked
Okay. What do a "traceroute <host>" show ? (pastebin, please).  From outside your network
- i don't have any machines outside my network.
Ah, that's why! :).  You have to enable a special feature in your router if you are trying to access your server from within your network on a public IP / domain.  What's your domian/IP ?
- [URL]
Hm, no. That dosn't work.  What's the IP ?
- or [URL]
Maybe you misconfigured DNS
- 213.64.134.153
Okay, looks right - weird..
- you are not getting any webpage served, right?
But again, the webserver is accessible through LAN ?.  Nope, no web page is being displayed
- yes
And 213.64.134.153 is YOUR ip, right ? Not some redirector, dyndns or what ever
- Nope, that's the ip to my router.
Okay, seems that port 80 is not open
what is the alternative i should research? to get it into single user mode?
Single user? Append "single" to the kernel command-line.
not all them. only youtube stuff can i see
and I thing the "restricted extras" comes with the flash plugin
ok, well anyway ty
but the quick answer should be "yes, you should"
goodbye. ok, thanks. i really appreciate your help nino
come back if something doesn't work
found something related in the bugs: [URL]
interesting
good question. How do I check?.  this nic would be my broadcom wireless
if you haven't set it up as dmz, it's probably not dmz.
that's what I was thinking ;).  nonetheless, is there any iptables madness I need to be messing with or something? Why would my wire connection not have this problem?
so this is your wireless nic? is it working with the internet, but not LAN?
exactly. I'm on the wireless nic right now, but I can't access any other computer on teh network
first thing to check is whether you're connected to the wireless network you think you're connected to... use iwconfig and look at the essid.
yup... I liked how xandros automatically set up all my partitions mounted and ready
it's a secrurity thing, if you can't access windows, you can't hurt it :)
hey . anywho  im sitting in DSL right now, what do i do
I'm cluess about irc, how about taking us private again
right-click on a selection of files and choose "create archive" in menu (Thunar, I think). yes the file manager is Thunar
can you show an example with a screenshot? you could upload it to [URL]
[URL]
and the 'home' directory inside the zip contains what?
the directory structure leading to the files you see below, which in this case is /home/me/Desktop/test.zip
hmm, are you running file-roller (the archiving utility) as root there? that's maybe not a good idea. i would recommend to resort to the comand line for this purpose..  which ubuntu release is this? lsb_release -ds
not as root afaik.  Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
okay i just misinterpreted the 'location' sown on your screenshot.. *shown. hmm, i'm afraid i really don't know then,  i also use thunar and file roller and i used to use it on 14.04 for a good while, but never had this happen.
yes I do. But I can't seem to boot from it
hold on, I saw that link just a min ago..  try this: [URL]  should be a guide to how to format/setup a USB drive to boot (with ubuntu) on that page, might not be the first item listed
I ran this earlier as root : chroot /miners/1 mount /proc.  what is the proper way to unmount this so I can delete it
reboot would be easy
k trying that.  that worked :-D
:) not sure how to un-chroot... there might be a better way
I'm trying to restore a backup, but it seems to have gotten stuck on "checking for backups"... Either that or I'm being impatient
Hmm. Run htop, see if it's acting up..  This never occured to me. It's very straightforward app.
'htop'?
htop, or Run "ps -aux | grep deja" -- Whatever the dejadup command is.
Ok... What am I looking for?
See if RAM or CPU is really high, that's it..  Are you trying to restore a large backup? If so, that may be the reason.
Doesn't seem so, no
How long have it been?
I'd say... about 25 minutes
Okay. Clearly something happened. It shouldn't really take that long. Different versions?
Nope, same version. I just did a reinstall
Meh. Can't say much. It's dead simple for me. Create. Restore. That's it.
Strange.... I'm also attempting to do it over the network, maybe that's why?
Ah. I never did it. I create it on the machine. Scp over the files..  Also, I like the last comment. [URL]
That was... Informative...
Get the files on the machine. See if it works better. I always hate the idea of bits getting lost over the network backup.
3rd gen 4 gb video
i think thats the prob
how would I do that?
[URL]
integrity management archatecture. does remote checksums to make sure system is as it should be
maybe that's "integrity measurement architecture"?
yes
i'm not into the concept, but [URL] "1.14. Integrity Management Architecture" mentions this
it didnt, or how do I restart it after I add users to that group?
/etc/init.d/sshd restart. guess 3rd time was the charm
having three VM's with EXT4, yes it does. Can i disable it w/out having to use EXT2 ?
the distinction between ext2/3/4 is not a bright line..  its perfectly valid to say ext4-journalling is ext3-journaling+extents or ext2+extents.  to focus only on the high level features
however if i keep using EXT4 i would still have the beneficts of SSD compatibility, such as trim. So can i just get rid of journalling w/out too many drawbacks?
if you disable the journal then you are disabling journaling
is it something that i write on /etc/fstab, right?
etunefs
since you certainly are more wise than me, if having too many SSD write rates concerns me, would it be a good idea to disable it?
if that is your concern then that is your concern. i cant say whether or not that is a good idea. that depends on how stable your system is and how much you value the security of the journal
did that... it's not picking it up for some strange reason.. well, ~/.mozilla/plugins and /usr/lib/flash-addons/plugins. Didn't try yours. Moment then.
what about other browser? like Opera? not trying to push you to it, just wondering if it's a chrome setting, rather than not reading it
firefox isn't working as well
ok.  dump it at /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
hello.  miksi?
ei onnistu multa :(
then what do I do to stop that module now?
sudo modprobe -r <module name>
cant, that causes my system to lockup and crash.
which module?
12.04.5. 12.04.4
You will need to show these errors to the channel in a pastebin , "Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.".  Give some details and mention any extra repos added.
[URL]
I said "to the channel", not me. Run a sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade and show all of it in a pastebin. You have to at the least fix the broken packages problem, or if attached to you installs in that context.
and how do I install it once I find it?
apt-get install packagename.  sudo/root is required
thanks!

sweet. my innodb tables are hosed. I need to back out so I can back them up and then upgrade again and restore them. It's just one database.
open synaptic, search for mysql-server go to package -> force-version
omg :) I tried to manually set like :set syntax=.. damn :)
i presume that can be added to '~/.vimrc' (i'm not actually a vim user ;). also, there are prepackaged debs for java. !javadebs
i put the disc in, and it does nothing, double clicking on the drive brings up an error.  "mount: special device /dev/scd1 does not exis"
... which is what
same with the other drive, but scd0 instead
ok - thats the useful bit. I can't find the interface I was expecting that could help - gimme a few minutes
ok, thanks.  just so you know, the drives both work under a windows partition on the same machine
Hmmmz - the interface appears to be missing... perhaps its been removed in newer versions of ubuntu. I can help, but its going to be tricky (command line editing of files)
why not since I need to burn this through tovid but it seems whenever I try to open it, it just doesnt respond
well a reboot would suffice if the DVD drive works after reboot but he othe way is unsafe
I was hoping you would tell me the command I really would prefer doing it through terminal instead of rebooting
well maybe doing "hdparm -w
what do you mean by maybe.... are you sure that is a restarting command
IIRC the hdparm -w /dev/path/to/DVD/ may restart the dvd drive. its a long shot
I read that mget is not for getting directories anyways.  and that you should tar it first
tar it first? What's the 'it' in this? (note, I have no more context than your question above)
the ftp man :P
you do not need to tar ftp. Nor to tar the files on the server to get them with mget
when I do what you say it does this: mget forums/[URL]p? y. local: forums/[URL]p: No such file or directory
But I probably still do not know what you meant with 'tar it' so maybe I'll just stop trying to help and let someone elso do it
well I just did mget *. and got that
Is it a public ftp server you are connecting to? I could give it a shot so see if there is something wrong at their end.  if it is your local server, check that you do have read permission on those files...
i didnt know it would even work with a ds3, lets see...
oh I have no idea. I just know there is a controller mapping program in BPM
That one works within firefox too?
mzz i dept lets see :D.  i see the pdf file i click on the link and it ask save or open with pdf reader...  [URL]
yea i tried that but the sound card is not showing
does it show with lspci?.  or sudo lshw?
yes i see hardware but no audigy/creative. . . still showing my onboard sound though.  i wonder if its just not getting loaded and have to do something with the modules
you disabled onboard and put in audigy?
yes
is card seated correctly?
yea, when i started ubuntu it showed that it detected a new module for a split second.  like on boot up, showed a new device before loading ubuntu.  should it just work out of the box or am i missing something?
type alsamixer in terminal which card is listed in top left corner?
via 8237, chip realtek alc. . .
thats the onboard sound?
cool - thanks  (got it right 3rd time)
lol :P.  need i make my name more complicated?
- you also use xtknight as a nick?
indeed. my home nick is at home with nickserv
- I see, we chatted before I think.
very likely ;)
;)
hwinfo show you that dimm stuff?.  also check out "sudo dmidecode" it may have more detailed info
if I activate one of those drivers (even the reccomended ones) and reboot I cant startx
I see... Ehm. Did you try sudo nvidia-xconfig before logging out?
no, but I did run it once I couldnt startx. it reconfig'd my xorg file however it still couldnt startx
And what did it output?
wizzup: the xorg file?
No, nvidia-xconfig. Did it say it was succesful?
wizzup: let me activate the driver and sudo run the config. I'll tell you extactly. Worst case I just reinstall for a9th time
I am sure you can disable the drivers without reinstalling
Well I'm not that good with linux to know what to do without a gui.  so I just reinstall. Prolly faster to spend 15 mins reinstalling then poke around tryin to startx without the driver again
There is probably an easy way. I'd tell you to google how to deactivate them, but meh.
alright, going to activate and sudo nvidia-xconfig. 1 sec
Let's pray.  You might also want to nvidia-settings before logging out. see if it states that you have to enable it
lucky number 8 eh?
:p
k activated and ran nvidia-xconfig. Output some warnings about "No layout specified constructing implicit layout section using screen defualt screen" and "Unable to find corepointer in X configuration, attempting to add new corepointer section"
Just a sec
it says it created a new x configuration file
That should be good then
k here goes a reboot
. Just log out
ooh, yeah... I'm using the netbook remix from the ubuntu site. afaik, it's based on eeebuntu
vesta, what eee u using
eee 1000
vesta, what eee u using/. vesta, sorry. vesta, did u check the list
the list?.  if I'm not on it does that mean I can't come in? :P
sorry on the ubuntu nbr site. there is a link called "popluar models" in the text. is there a #eeebuntu somewhere?
thanks for the pointer. I've taken a look. the only issue listed is to do with sound performance with pulseaudio, but I've already taken that off to fix another problem. sorry, microphone stuttering
vesta, well that's all i can think of, try the eeebuntu
i dont think i have xterm
You do unless you deleted it. Hit Alt+F2 and enter "xterm"

Sara22: no problem! ndiswrapper is a little piece of software that allows one to use certain windows drivers under linux. Sara22: are you familiar with the Terminal?
yes :)
Sara22: super! ok, pop one open and type 'sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper ndisgtk'
it says couldn't find package ndiswrapper
Sara22: sorry! using old package names just use 'sudo apt-get install ndisgtk'. Sara22: that will handle the dependency (ndiswrapper itself, which is split into two packages)
ok done!
sweet! now we need the windows (so called 'ndis') driver.
who do I get that?
Sara22: I'm just trying to hunt one down for you; and it seems that there might've been a native linux driver made recently
thank you!
Sara22: from realtek's website; if i'm not mistaken, that gateway should have a realtek 8187B chipset. you can check by typing 'dmesg | grep -i Realtek'. or 'lspci | grep -i realtek'

desktop probably does
touch /forcefsck. what would it take to bring back sysvinit
/forcefsck is not an everyday occurance. For normal filesystems with staggered check intervals, no one would notice. (that said, it is still a bug)
until your uptime exceeds the check intervals
that is the one thing missing from your bug report. the impact. it is unclear how much time is "lost" from checking the partitions simultaneously instead of searially. [i agree this is a bug btw]
5x
but how much actual time is that
who cares, I'm probably about to replace the entire boot sequence anyway
because 2 minutes every 3 months is slightly annoying at most.
what's annoying is the obvious incompetance of the developers. in trying to squeeze a few extra seconds they demonstrated they do not understand unix
fstab has a well defined syntax that defines behavior that is not being honored, it is a bug. But i don't think *this* is the issue to wage a jihad against upstart over.
no external cd support...
perhaps you can start up another OS just to get CD support, then run Ubuntu intall?
I've a very minimal X terminal distribution working now (I don't know the linux core if it's debian or other)
unfortunally i'm a beginner at this, can't help you i'm afraid. :(
can I install from network with X terminal? if yes, how? can you send me a link with some help about network setup for ubuntu? (this is my first time with linux...)
there's extensive help to be found on ubuntu forums, i'd try that one.
Kernel blah blah blah blah 3
there is no 'GUI' and 'text' runlevels like many other distros use
I just removed it and reinstalled it with apt-get
it should be part of the apache2-common package
losha: the things that terry_ had suggested i try in the terminal
try them again then, I suppose...
> I don't really care as long as it can easily be installed via apt-get...
seems like it is in there. I haven't tried that though
well, I'm just using the energy manager from the control center. Set up for suspend
Which is set as?
When the lid is closed -> Suspend, both in battery and AC mode
The base of my question is to wake up hit a key, hit the power button...etc
Ah, sorry, the power button is supposed to wake up from sleep mode

What version of Ubuntu do you have installed?
i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but i'm still getting chinese character of the data all in one line. 0erHeks: where can i find it? i did whereis LibreCalc and just got LibreCalc back. 0erHeks: ok i figured it out..somehow it got switched to unicode
ah nice
but will it work with all the encryption handshake mumbo-jumbo that you have to do when connecting to gmail?
yes; starttls/ssl, the works, and extremely leightweight as well.  it's not a full blown MTA though, if that's what you need
thanks! i'm going to ask you again when things screw up though :)
lol, deal, i guess i had that coming ;)
it will boot with any other Vista but business and ultimate SP1
it works with Ultimate SP1 for me
terminal
the default terminal application? how is it being launched/where from
i make it so ctrl + ` launches terminal. but i'd like the xfce-terminal to be launched instead of gnome terminakl
You should be able to add custom actions, just bind Ctrl-` to run xfce-terminal, and clear the "Open Terminal" binding

10.10 server. just installed ubuntu-dekstop hoping it would help. same result as terminal though. connections are made and dropped. huge packet loss. what else. wpa2.. ive got wpa_supplicant configured... although im not sure it's totally correct..  also, it's a sony vaio laptop. i had this working perfectly the otherday.. then i did a reformat and havent been able to get it working since.
did you check to ensure your wireless card is on the list of compatible cards.
i havent checked. but it does work.
are you sure it's your card? How's the access point?
iwconfig shows the macaddress for the router.
you can try shutting down your networking card and booting it back up again "/etc/init.d/networking stop | start" and "/etc/init.d/wicd start | stop
link quality is only 47/70.. but that shouldnt make this kind of diference.  sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop returned the following.. "postconf: fatal: .etc.postfix/main.cfg no suck file dir along with RTNETLINK answers :No such process and SIODELRT :no such process
can you try "/etc/init.d/networking restart"
Yeap, processor usage remains at 2.50 max
when you did a fresh install did you select the restricted modules for your proprietary opengl support DRI etc...  I'm wondering if its your videocard trying to run opengl with vesa or non-dri drivers
hmmm.... well I dont recall such option but my video card's drivers are working fine or at least I think so, I can load the gears just fine
run glxinfo.  do you see a: direct rendering: Yes
Yeap, I see direct rendering yes
hmm ok so its not that.  what are you running in particular? anything intense?
almost every file now, can't open home direcotry, no wireless, no google chrome just popups flooding
does dmesg say anythong about remounting filesystems readonly after errors?
i keep getting this error for 5 weeks, but it used to fix just with fsck, now nothing works, i reinstalled many times and get this error but not with windows, It used to work fine with ubuntu couple months ago though
if your filesystem breaks this often: make a backup and buy a new disk
but not for windows ?
the broken part of the disk could be limited to just the ubuntu partition(s)
what about gdisk?
I am not familiar with gdisk..  That is all I have to offer right now.
Crap. I'm used to skype's edit function.

those other mountpoints you tried aren't specified in the file either. Not that this would work but the mount point ought to be, according to the fstab, /media/cdrom0
same thing about special device not existing
yeah I figured. I don't get it. Hardware failure?
fine in windows. seems to see it in syslog
well I got nothing then
got any good documentation on that, ive looked around for that as well, on google, only see references to logical volumes of some sort
-> the latest orielly edition on linux system administration covers that, also the ubuntu book by craig i believe covers it quite good too
thnx. whats the name of the orielly book. exactly
rather a practical guide to ubuntu linux by Mark Sobell
what ver
the latest version, i believe is 3rd
so im supposed to use "dd" then gparted, then mke2fs....then mount?
yeah.. sounds like you did just make a too mall partition. Probable due to fdisk not being the easiest of applications.
something similar to what bash is, but posix-compliant. I always confuse shell prompt and shell so if i spoke wrong, forgive me
no problem, bash is actually IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools compliant
?
OPera
opera.  I was looking for it under the package manager but couldn't find it... any reason why? What could I search for?
manual install, go to [URL] and get the ubuntu debs. then sudo dpkg-i *opera package name*
I can't since I can't get on firefox. Could you DCC me?
i am on Gaim, DCC is out.  or else just apt get konqueror
what is konqueror?
KDE's versitle browser cum file manager
I adjusted a setting before to fix that. it was in linux. tom_, yes it was.  yup
how do you know?
do they
Oh, I dont' know. I found one on sourceforge, but can't remember what it's called. Look there
: you're not 'sure'? so you know something?
i know that jailbreaking anything breaks your warrenty, and i won't help you do it ;) but i'm sure if you googled around, you could find your answer....
: i once googled ,but not any results...
i just found an ubuntu forum topic about it...... [URL]
!theme development. !develop. crap
Go to [URL] and look for a "Tutorials" link on the right side of the page.
blueeagle: grub-gfxboot
gerinych: And did you reinstall grub to the boot record of the booting device?
not acceptable? that's the logical explanation why my user who is in sudoers doesn't work?. I am logged in as a personal user that is in sudoers file
you just said you are root
no i'm not, at least not now
you said you where root a few lines up
under root meaning under the line in visudo
please show me the output of the command "id"
under the line that defines nopasswd for root. uid=1000(wiz) gid=1000(wiz) groups=1000(wiz),27(sudo),119(openerp)
can you show me your full sudo line please.
yes sure .  this is after it failed to work just for that script and tried the wildcard :[URL]
remove the space between : and ALL
thank you,
!vim | .  Thought that would give you a doc reference .. I'll got find one for ya, VIM wise.
I have the general knowledge of vim. But I can't find how to go to the insert mode. I tried to do it with ESC :i after starting vi, but it doesn't work.

do you use vim?
No.
vlc
Also, are you certain that the video quality itself is bad ?
well, the thing is that the quality is better when I run beryl or compiz
Never used vlc...
but in the normal gnome session the quality is just bad. however, under beryl/compiz the colors are messed up
Again, are you sure the video ITSELF the quality isn't bad ?
yes, I'm sure
Ie. have you played this on another computer and its not sucky
okay. with TORSMO. when i tried to ./configure it. it said checking for X... no. Sorry, X is very much needed

i think it is but in opnline very mach people say thet need to manual instal vga drivers or something. :D. ok then
quite a few people have also had issues with ATI drivers in 9.04
well i have a program called xbconnet. [URL]
I have absolutely no idea because this channel isn't a support channel for that
oh hi
you did that why?
I did what why?
posted the bash quote.
hmm. wait a minute. I don't even have that script installed any more. D:
apparently you do.
try mounting the disk in windows; if all you see is one file, you burned it wrong
all i see is one file :-P
tar -cvvzf. gzip. gzipped tar*

the regular expression is what i need i think
look here. [URL]  you can just modify it for an absolute patch to a file
thanks :)
No problem. Do you think you can help me with my wifi problem I mentioned above? :)
wish i could but i dont know anything about wifi, mine have all just been supported out of the box
OK.

Welcome. Morning?? Someone's on the wrong side of the pond ;-)
hard disk. Old Western Digital Passport
then this approach should work. there may also be firmware upgrades available for this drive..  btw. it's unpleasent to notice you asking the same wquestion here and in #debian. please don't do this in the future.
Could you enlighten me? ^^
chmod -R permissions /folder/
where does the spesific group get involved in those permissions?. afaik that command only sets global permissions on that folder?
you do chgrp -R group /folder/
ah
-R does it for everything inside. recursively
I'm trying to install onto an iMac,. the live cd works,
Which iMac?
but the install doesn't,. a lime,. rev C maybe.
How does the install fail?
The X windows system cannot start,
Yeah, I have a grape here. Can you log in on the console and check /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
> after ?
than a folder will open look on the left side colum
: opened what u said , now what ?.  : left column also has that duplicate.
in that folder on the colum remove the duplicates
which folder ?.  how do i remove the duplicates ?
the one nautilus opened
i opened the terminal , did a "nautilus"..my home folder opened.. now what do i do ?
yes and on the colum on the left is there duplicates is so remove the duplicates
how do i remove the duplicates which are shown under the Places Column ,  ?
yes
: im asking HOW DO I REMOVE ? i cant find an option to remove...if i right click , i dont see something like remove.
right click
, OH , remove is greyed out.
did you close the terminal ?
: no i didnt , i just put nautilis . nautilus opened , and terminal returned to prompt ?
ok redo it again than. !ntfs
Any timeframe for the availability of a live CD?
can't answer that I'm afraid, although if somebody outside the core team wanted to give it a shot they'd be most welcome :).  for warty, we'll probably only have i386
no i try compiz i want some thing diffrenet
with gnome?
I am trying to learn Joomla and have successfully installed LAMP on my VirtualBox under Win7. so far so god. now I followed a tutorial how to do that. and my Joomla is installed to var/www/. now I want to work on a tutorial on how to make a joomla template from scratch. and it starts out: "make a new folder in your joomla template directory". but I cannot do that
how are you trying to do it?
I go to the folder var/www/joomla/templates and right click, like i would do it in windows. should I use the terminal and sudo mkdir?
that would be the way I would do it :)
ok cool thanks :). so one more question about this..
yea
linux as a standard has disabled file permissions on any other than the usr folder. which is good and I understand that. to keep the sys clean. but why would I break from this rule here?
not quite sure what you are asking :)
thanks.
np
I see "Launch Terminal ... Ctrl+Alt+T" and yet that doesn't do anything.
you can change it ... press the line with you mouse, and in the same time press ctrl+a for example
I am more interested in making the current setting work.
ctrl-alt-tab it's not working neither for me .... so i changed
i am trying to get the kernel source to install Nvidia drivers, ive done this on fedora before just not ubuntu, i installed linux-kernel-source but that says its for 2.6.28 kernel
oh dear.  ok you install the Nivida drivers from the Ubuntu repo, and "only" as a last resort, if you got some problem, the offical Nivida drivers from their website, otherwise your bound to get problems
ah
system > administaration > hardware drivers, there should be the repo one available
i thought the official ones would be better
no the ones directly from them tend to = problems
bit of a no brand. Its a tevion (german brand). not sure of the model.. not much help, i know
try googling their website for linux drivers?. im not too good with hardware...
>: yeah im on dalnet...how do i get rif of it?. rif=rid
i dunno how to solve it. Though, i think theres a self boot command as you know the password for the account
ok
id wait to see if any ops come in and ask them
understood, but the plan is to fork of debian
since many of the ubuntu devs are debian devs, they will probably still keep many ties
wifi
what kind of wireless card do you have? (do you know how to find out?)
wifi.  no i dont.  i do know it was working on my 8.04
run this command: sudo lspci -k (and pastebin the output) Do you know how to pastebin?.  If it worked on 8.04 I am very confident I can get it working on 10.10
i cant pastebin the output cause that comp isnt connected
Then read it and tell me what it says (look for the bit about your wifi) I think you can figure it out even though it's a lot of output..  I'm looking for something like this Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 (with a different number there)
[URL]
liar! :D.  You have BCM4312 Do you see it there?
yes i see it now.  i dont know what that means though.  but i still cant enable my wireless
It's basically the model of the wifi chip. It lets me know which driver to use. (the b43 driver). I can also see that the b43 driver is already being used on the card. Can you tell me what 'sudo iwlist scan' does?.  I know, still just info finding. run that command: sudo iwlist scan.  that command tests if it is working
new. edib
new?. edib?
network down
what is you do this: sudo ifup wlan0 ?.  BTW, how did you pastebin that command before?
"ignoring unknow interface wlan0=wlan0.  i copied to a document that transfered through usb
Mmmm, do you have a /lib/firmware/b43 folder? (that is were the firmware is stored) we need both the firmware and the driver for this to work. I know the driver is there. I'm also sure the card is not working so we'll check the firmware.  Additionally, if the firmware is missing you will see error messages about it new the end of the output of dmesg (that's a command).  How is it going?
it happens when im watching youtube / listening to music. doesnt matter as long as its got sound. its just a popping / clicking sound. just a pop or click
repeating, or just once/

yes. np
Ikonia: I have now the folder with this commando: apt-get install --reinstall apache2.2-common
ok, so apache wasn't installed
but now I need [URL]nf
looks to me like you have deleted /etc/apache2
yeah. but now its here
is that what you did ?
yes
why didn't you saw that then ?.  rather than "I have installed apache and /etc/apache2 is not there"
yeah because it's don't create me this folder
it did create the folder, you deleted it
mind going in with some more detailed information?
if you create a mount point for it under /media/ it will show up on the desktop
i got a folder on it that i want to be loaded as the Desktop folder for my user :/.  not just mount it to media everytime
you have to add it to /etc/fstab so it mount automatically on each boot.  make ~/Desktop be a symbolic link to the folder you want
aah i understand now :P

Do you not understand the instructions?
transmission keeps pausing the downloads, i don't know why, and vizu says my files are too large
transmission is part of a default install. Windows users have to manually install a client making it harder than in Ubuntu.  what file system are you using to store your torrent files? Does it have free space?
i just formatted a 2TB external HDD with ext4
ok. What is the output of : lsb_release -a; df -i; uname -a; df -h
should i excecute this command in terminal?
use [URL] or similar to host the text.  yes please
[URL]
looks good. Are you settling the download to go to /media/theone/Films ?
yes
did you recursively chown the mount point to your user?
no, and i am not sure what that means,
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/theone.  so that your user is the owner of the data and can write to it.
hmmm, i am not sure what that means yet, :-( seems complicated.  and i still get the same error, file too large, i just tryed the torrent again
copying and pasting text is complicated?
its on the page
what is?
;) i just want to make sure they cant ssh in but leave their stuff aronud in case i want tor estore it later
you can disable the shell too. make it /bin/false. or /usr/sbin/nologin
the one that i currently have came with the distro, and i cant find a package with libn1 in it :(.  big enough to find this freaking dev package :)
what are you trying to accomplish
i need to get iw installed.  i dont have any version installed and google / apt-cache search, are giving me no hits

time to buy new hardware ;-)
Why do you think so? The laptop (ThinkPad X31) is perhaps 3yo. And it never froze with Breezy while it has been freezing nearly a dozen times with Dapper.
I would suspect that changing hardware might increase system stability - but I believe you, my desktop system keyboard locks up once/day at precisely 1:06am every morning. Breezy was fine, but the problem started with my upgrade to Dapper :-(.  maybe our problems are related somehow? Do you have any good URLs on the problem?
Hm. And what about the people discussing the freezing problem on ubuntuforums? I feel I am not alone..  No, sorry. I read the forums and they said it might be the gfx driver. But who knows...
if you don't have a URL handy, then I'll just track it down :-)

yer telling me!.  but I've found no good way to remove PA and go back to ALSA

alsa is always there , PA just rides on top

lamenting the fact that debian/ubuntu seems to be the only distro out there that doesn't update eclipse?.  I 'spose. why?
dont know if its still around or what its like if it is but exhaile (or maybe exaile?) was supposed to be a gtk very close to amarok clone
looks nice.. will test it out. Thanks!
is it still alive?
very much so, it seems [URL]/
cool, not sure if I am glad to see that though since I am a huge amarok fan =)
yeah, amarok is excellent I agree.  I'm just trying to experiement and see if I can do without my last few kde apps.  k3b amarok taskjuggler eric digikam
yes..  but the menu is available in ubuntu too. I can't find it though, because I don't remember the name.
USP?.  Ubuntu...system Panel?
menu?. yes, a panel menu.
[URL]
I can't find that in synaptic?
It's not in synaptic, as far as I know..  The link I pointed you to has packages.
default-jre-headless depends on openjdk-6-jre-headless. I do not want java6, just java7.
Well since java7 is not default then default-jre-headless will not provide it (I guess)
That sucks, because lots of things depend on default-jre-headless.
What you would do is uninstall the default jre-headless package and the java6 packages you don't wnat and then install the java7 packages..  It's a ponter package so they don't really rely on the default-jre-headless package they just need a jre-headless pacakge installed. I had the same thought as you on ubuntu-default though when removing a piece of software once. It wanted to remove half my system. However removing the pointer package did resolve the issue.
what's not there? it prints this message every time i start up the terminal
it means that dir doesnt exist
what directory?
/dev/cgroup/cpu/user/7957/tasks
i haven't typed anything yet when it prints this. so i should make it?
no. dont know why its saying that
neither do i :<
i dont know what you messed up before :s. a long time ago...
lol, i dont remember :s. i will try making the directory, to see what it does. who knows :p
it may get rid of the error. you might get a new one. either way, somethings wrong
i did it,  the error changed. it is now:. mkdir: cannot create directory `/dev/cgroup/cpu/user/8229': Permission denied. bash: /dev/cgroup/cpu/user/8229/tasks: No such file or directory
your not gona be able to fix it by manually making all them files
nopes, don't have any options there
using hoary?
any in particular?
whatever works :) I have no experience with the setup you described, so we just have to try and see. This mini display port by the way is still from your ati card?
yeah.. HD 5970 two DVI, one mini display port.
also, do you know if ati provides some special program to configure things? I know nvidia does
it does of which I tried to use to solve with no luck, it's called ATI Catalyst Control Center.
ah
made some amendments, trying it out, if not rm -fr /media/ubuntu/. thanks for your willingness to help though.
keep in mind these are issues with ati's driver :) But of course you have to have some things work regardless of whose fault it is

ok i have done that i think just to make sure tell me again how to do that?
"Display Manager" -> "Multi-Display" -> "Single display desktop (Multi-desktop)"
ok i have already done that and no display on tv
can you see your second display listed there?
yes as orion
and does it actually say something like "no signal" on the other monitor?
NO\.  no sorry
what's on the other screen?
just blank hdmi 1
hit ok in the control panel and restart the xserver.  then open a terminal and type DISPLAY=:0.1 xterm

run mplayer on whatever you did before and tell me what audio output method its using (alsa, esd, ...)
the output method is definitely alsa.  mplayer says "alsa-init: using device default"
hmm, so you do have a /dev/dsp right?
yep
does your sound card setup have a headphone out jack you can check?. !alsa>
no, i checked it all.  not that stupid :)
eh its not stupid. Something is funky. Do you mind running through [URL] ?

create vcd from video file mpeg1 some mpeg2
why not dvds?
because i only got about 1.3 Gigs worth, not worth wasting Dvd for that, they only music video clips for a friend
to play in their vcd player, or on their computer?
tnx.  but it's the lenght?
no the size. how would ls know the lenght ?
any tool which pipes this file table and reads the lenght
you can use find and run a program that displays multimedia metadata. maybe file itself

tell me please can i rename localized folders in /home/user ?. i use Ubuntu 14.04
sure.. your user has permission to change data there easily.  though, the system may be looking for specific directories.. what is the goal?
for example the page i setup for my bandwidth monitor "http://localhost/cacti.  it doesn't show the page, it considers it a file
does this page [URL] display correctly?
I.  I'm going to delete everything about the packages and then reinstall.
yes, that'll purge it out of your system.  better yet, why not use aptitude or apt-get ?.  sudo aptitude purge packagename.  sudo aptitude install packagename.  that'll remove it, including everything (config files, etc) then reinstall it

OpticalTouchScreen. ViewSonic TD2220
what machine it come on?
the docs seem pretty out of date. is there some setting, on some panel somewhere, where I just need to turn it on?.  geistest says "error subscribing to gestures". error subscribing window. anyone have advice on getting a Quanta OpticalTouchScreen device working (ViewSonic TD2220) ?
hmm. What DE you using/
DE?. Desktop environment? unity
desktop environment
unity.  everything is basically standard. 13.04
unity snatches all gestures, so you can't remap occupied stuffs, without patching unity and removing the default gestures
very thanks!!!!!

Yes

i dont like to see it there. im using lucid not karmic :\
then change it to lucid.
I did remove it, but I don't think I logged off yet
or jsut remove the icons from the launcher, open the dash and drag the launchers from there
the dragging works, but the icon changes to the old version :/
no idea then, sorry
i installed that ...but it wont start
what's the problem?
the problem is, to get the iso bootable on my ext. hdd
tried editing a little bit in BIOS?.  every computer at startup prioties what to boot from. Usually external harddrives are below normal harddrives
the PC knows the ext. hdd and boot option is set to removable
So you've configured that it should boot from the USB?
allrighty then idiocracy on the operator's part :)
imap, pop, groupwise, exchange, whatever

try installing cygwin
do i need cygwin on any windows boxes i use?. because i am setting this up more for my *at school use*
as far as i am aware you will have to run an X server on any machine you wish to forward X to
ok are there any Java based apps for that, that i can download?. java is the ONE thing my school cant take from me:)
the alternative would be to use vnc or nx
i see. i can stick with text terminals i guess:) those are more 1337 than VNC. and i dont want to open up anymore ports on my router
if you run nx you won't need to open any new ports
i wont? it will work through port 22?
(it uses ssh)
thats what i like to hear:) you get my attention when you say SSH:)
the server is in the seveas repository, but it is a little bit of a fiddle to set up
Ah, i mean programs for ubuntu/linux users. Like games
what are you talking about ?
how to I figure it out? I just got this computer recently. I've done lspci, and it's bcm4310. if that's what you mean
yeah, that's I mean :)
ok. so what do I do now?
well if you ude ndiswrapper, AFAIK, you can get use the drivers that windows would use
I've followed some instructions days ago, but none worked out
actually,I saw an auto-ndiswrapper app a while back that looks for the driver automatically, I will try to find it again, brb
ok, thank you
[URL]/
thanks, I'll try to install and I'll report back
awesome, I will be gone, but if could message me a quick message to tell me how that worked out, it would be great (I am curious about the competence of the auto-ndiswrapper).  but if you could *
I will be sure to
thanks :)
it said card is not yet supported
oy! sorry then, what instructions did you follow that didn't work ?
This one recently, because I didn't feel like dealing with NDIS, and the section with "wget", the file is not available [URL] and the one with NDIS is coming in a minute
can you use the ndiswrapper frontend ?
I'm not sure, but I'm fairly certain the reason it didn't work before was because I was using the wrong driver
you can install a GUI that will make ndiswrapper more painless (such as Ndisgtk or NdisConfig that I've used with success).  and then you can point ndiswrapper (via frontend) to the windows driver for your card
alright. cool, thanks.
have you found/got windows drivers for your card /. ?.  and I am pretty sure you can get NdisConfig with synaptic or apt-get
Stargazing is basically one of my largest pasttimes.
too much light pollution where I am at the mo :(
Same here but it's a passion.
!services
Yes, there is, however I thought it connected to another spot on the motherboard, as my old one had it there too
does your board have a secondary connection for that connection? if not use it.. otherwise you might need to buy a new pwrsupply
sure that's good enough for watching, but I want to test it overnight
it keeps the totals over night.
Xorg and compiz
thinks that compiz is harder in 10.04
should I try turning it off?
disable effects.  set Visual effect to none
Modify of course
isn't the 'write' the same?
Yes I dont have write only read and delete
so this is on vista part, write click on share and add more permissions
I can create files, and delete them. But I cant write in the files. Don't think it's a vista problem, I have full permissions for my user on this share.
check those files specific permissions on vista, may be they are readonly (individual files not entire share)
tried to access login screen from artwork program cant do that..just download the file...and cant set login screen from system-administrations. what is wacom anyways. ok. E-invalid operation updates
[URL]/
i see...
you can use Ctrl+L to change location in most of the GUI file explorers then navigate to ~.  ~ is a shortcut to your home folder for me /home/shaun/ you'll have write permissions there.  if you want to know more about permissions check out, chmod, chown, and ls -al commands which let you modify permissions, change owner ship, and list folders/files with permission info
how do i turn that off
You shouldn't turn it off completely. Reduce the percentage.. now hm
:)
i thought i read somewhere it wasn't such a bad thing.
Already tried that approach. Seems to have screwed up my wireless connection.
oh well.  why do you want a server install?.  use the computer as server?
I want more space on my computer; only have 2GB HD..  I tried the other apprach, removing packages. So far so good, except for my wireless connection..  Everyone keeps telling me to try a server install and then add the packages I need from there.
ok.  then do one.  or did you say something like, I dont have a cd drive
Yes, I don't have a CD drive. So I'm wondering how to run a server install.
then how did you get ubuntu in the first place?
Long story.
humm
Don't I just need to change the [URL]st or something?
same reps.  keep removing packages until your done then try getting wireless up and running.  try to figure out which package you removed that screwed up wireless
When you uninstall packages, what are some good things to check after (to make sure everything is running okay). For example, apt-get -f install
make sure not to remove something... bad
is that the exact name?
I think so. Search synaptic to be sure.
foolsrun, i cant.. i am using my intergrated video and xorg wont start.. so i need the exact name... i dont know how to apt-get search anything
try fglrx, I think that's it.
flashplugin-nonfree is already newest version
then flash is installed.... cant you watch youtube vids?
yeah, half the time flash files show up black though
wich ubuntu have you? 8.07 or 8.10?
8,10
ahhh lol had the same problem.... i have removed firefox and flashplugin-nonfree.... ( dpkg -P flashplugin-nonfree; dpkg -P firefox ) and have installed then everything new.  ahhh lol had the same problem.... i have removed firefox and flashplugin-nonfree.... ( dpkg -P flashplugin-nonfree; dpkg -P firefox ) and have installed then everything new
and it works?
yep now it works here. dont know if it works for you then too
I want to get my kernel configuration, not my kernel
look for the .config files :).  /boot/config/$(uname -r)
-- i used to be able to run an isc-dhcp server, but recently it isn't working properly anymore.  -- i took the server offline and am directly connected to my router at the moment
if no answer in this channel, ask in #ubuntu-server. Sadly, I can't help with this issue.
-- so how do i switch to the #ubuntu-server? /join #ubuntu-server?
correctomundo!
how to test if its working or not?
which tool/packages r the BEST in keeping laptop cool? (throttle down to 400-600 MHz) In windows i used notebook hardware control which can throttle down to 130Mhz. play music in stereo and surround mode
Good to know. I'm a big big green novice heh..  Mind you both my mouse and keyboard are ps2... Wont that prejudice the solution?
That option usb_handoff works often on certain chipsets, even if the mouse or keyboard is ps2 and not usb
Well, you gave me something new to try and revolve around. I really appreciate it, thanks!!!!
Please report back results, either good or not
thanks
or lshw.  lsusb
i can check - however, its a default installation so it hasn't changed much - doesn't it get installed by default?
not sure
the said package is installed
then no idea, sorry. I don't actuallly use bash
if i want crontab to remove contents of a directory that typically requires sudo to do so
well, do it from root's crontab
oh I have windows hibernated so acess to the drive might be bloccked. could that be the probem?.  partition, not drive.  but it doesnt see my old ubuntu either (wanted to erase that)
that would prevent the os from mounting the partitions.. but it would stll see them.. Unless they are on some raid or other weird setup.  i would be carefull that you DO install to the proper place
dabar sudo wont open anything
sudo visudo
i can edit sudo if that makes you feel better . sudo visudo. sudo: can't open /etc/sudoers: Permission denied. tty2 [root#~] postdrop: warning: unable to look up public/pickup: No such file or directory
rescue mode? Recovery or whatever it is called in grub when you reboot...
dabar NO !
free the whales.
i was running sudo as root
just visudo?
dabar ok i have it open now what ?
what are you trying to do?
get sudo to work
add yourself to the file.
root is there already. root ALL=(ALL) ALL
ALL=(ALL) ALL
dabar so why can't root run sudo ?
why do you need to run sudo with root?. !dapper
thank you ! i need just to create a dialup connection in 9.04
alright.  What have we tried so far?
diffrent things
ok
which is the best one
myself I do not know sicne I just use backups that I have
ok well name one of the programs
testdisk
the default is 95%, where is this currently set?
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/ ??.  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold
yes
System>Administration>Software sources can help you find a closer mirror
could i get some help with ccsm?
just state the problem.
i just recognized your screen name, you replied to one of my posts once :). well, compiz is kinda buggy. it flashes whenever i switch workstations
at the UF?
if i do update everything is fine
what happens if you do an update, then the install?.  is there more to the error message? tbh i have not seen an error message with ...... in it
no i mean since like edgy or dapper or when. dw lol
It looks like everyone here is asking questions and I have seen maybe... two answers so far.. >.< Damn.. So I guess that would be a negative with my question.. :(
that's what I realised. is it all that old ?! come on !
last ubuntu support is in 12.04 on the precise stack (kernel 3.2)
I should go for radeon drivers then
would be the best option. there should be huge improvements to the radeondriver in 14.04 too
this is new for me and i dont know HOW to set it up to do it
depends a lot on what you actually want to do
store and retrieve data on them. i can get 10 P4 3ghz machines cheaper than i can but/build a single machine
well... you are not being very specific, but i doubt this will pay off
yes
if you figure that out, let me know
a brick ?.  no the Fn that normally works,wont work on any ubuntu vertion i try so far
what sort of laptop do you have?
oooh yeah!! why didn't i think of that -.- and how do i access the grub menu again?
reboot. and it should present itself for a few seconds
it doesn't unless i push something, but i forgot the key
just hit your down arrow when it comes up to go into selection mode and pause the timer.. you can also edit your grub timeout.... just a sec. [URL] there you go. that'll tell you everything you never wanted to know about configuring grub on ubuntu
there is silence
how long did you wait?
8 minutes
certainly not enough then
ok.  do you know how in general work postfix?. where that IMAP and SMTP hostame I should take?
sadly no, but I would search for a tutorial
lol.  it's ext3
ok, first, apt-get install quota
can I use that from Ubuntu 13.04. I would love to stick a dagger into Unity's head
absolutely. i usually go follow this: [URL]
I see.
apt-get install konqueror maybe?
Trying to compile tyrquake from source, everything compiles ok. Then I get this at the end: '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXxf86dga'. Any clues?. sry.  I have the last one installed
libxxf86dga-dev seems a likely needed one.
Thank you
basically you need export if you want to call subprocesses and have them be aware of the variable. cheers
Ah. Do you know where it's installed then?. Beacuse I've been looking everywhere
you used winetricks to install steam.  it'd probably be in ~/.wine somewhere
Yes
find ~/.wine -iname '*steam*'.  might also be findable via the dash/board thing
energizer, I wouldn't building partitions are part of the install in arch.
(but my ubuntu doesnt have access to a swap paritition. isnt that shitty?)
You only need one swap arch will build it.. energizer, Heh, and if you thought this was confusing a arch install will really be a challenge, it is a bit easier now, but it has its pitfalls.
ok so if i go into the arch people, they'll help me produce a partition for arch and another for swap (which will be applicable to both arch and ubuntu). how do i make ubuntu access the swap partition that i make over there
its says english.  doesnt say singapore english
are you on dapper? or breezy?.  vim /etc/environment if you're on dapper
[URL] this is the dmesg output. it have some acpi warnings and errors
tell us why we are looking at this.
because I have some warnings and errors in ACPI. and bekks said me that I must upgrade the bios to the new version to solve the problem. but this haven't solve it
Out of my area other than some good foo on the net which brings up lots..  This 14.04?
can you elaborate slightly? I want to make sure that I can run GNOME/KDE/Fluxbox without anything messing up; I don't intend to switch to KDE exculsively
that's by design, i don't think even regular ubuntu-desktop in intrepid doesn't have displayconfig-gtk anymore, the kubuntu desktop you are installing will have alternative packages to get the same functionality
g-force mx 400.  all the new ones taint kernel. and ones from nvidia site seem to really bork up a lot of package automation
I have GeForce 6200 and found that the 96 driver is the only one that works correctly for my card
thanks. not the answer that I was hoping for. In my mind, there should be a way to configure linux to permit non root users to bind to lower ports.
Sharperguy: add it to [URL]
lshw lists all the hardware
sorry, brain cramp, ifconfig?
How to do that?
modify /etc/default/grub and replace quite splash with text - sudo update-grub.  then from the shell sudo service lightdm start.  or gdm or what you have
on power hibernate but it doesn't seem to do that.
I never hibernate under Ubuntu, try setting it to suspend. That's what I've always used
Suspend is to sleep?
Yup, suspend is sleep
So it should not get hot when in sleep right... I come back and my laptop is really hot..
Suspend is the equivalent of Sleep in Windows. So no, your laptop shouldn't be getting hot during suspend. AFAIK
I will try it.
I've always had bad luck with hibernate, both in Windows and most Linux distros I've tried
what's atpit+. ?
at this point in time..
that advice is for what? port forwarding?
type that and give me the ip address
inet addr:192.168.2.3 Bcast:192.168.2.255 Mask:255.255.255.0.  i found my dell router's port forwarding settings page.
so you must type: 192.168.2.1 in your web browser to get to your router settings
Port Forwarding Settings page says that Port Forward is enabled for Transmission. Incoming port is "1~1". Destination IP address is 192.168.2.3..  yes, i'm on my router settings now.. how do i get an open port for transmission?
what port did you put for transmission to use?
you mean in Transmission's program settings or my router settings?
in the transmissions...
by the way,  according to [URL] port forwarding is needed only if NAT is not working. Can we not get transmission to use nat, so that we can avoid port forwarding?
actually, you are using NAT.
wat works?
notepad for example.  [URL] has some examples as well. most of those programs need a specific version of wine though
how do i run it?
wine notepad.exe.  in a terminal.  or wine whatever.exe
which cache?
firefox , right ?
yes
firefox , clean it.  history, i mean
what do you mean?
history - clean recent history
didn't help. i'll try erasing the cached web content
select all the item in 'clean history'. *s
it will detect and install drivers automatically?
mine was plug and play
the one I'm buy is a USB one. are you in Canada?
im in Ireland :)
ohh
its a usb one
yes
my one is. and it detected fine
yes
not really then, it's possible for nautilus "extensions" to add items, but you can't customise it beyond that
some, yeah
have u got any documentation for me?
yeah, a short one. install winex, winex hl.exe :).  it's pretty much working out of the box these days
hl.exe?
half-life, counter-strike, etc
even with XP?
huh?
with windows XP i mean
i dont need windows at all to play windows games. with wine
ok, maybe i am quite confus..that's why i need to read man :). btw ubuntu is great. :)
thanks. also, what is a good opensource pdf read/writer?. editor
evince. for reading. dunno about writing
it has tabs?
I dont think so
ok thank for the help
amixer set 'IEC958' off
how do i do that?
type it in a Terminal
still now sound
and, amixer set 'Master Mono' unmute && amixer set 'Master Mono' 80%
crimson still nothing
err, you overrode ~/.asoundrc ? hmm. This is going to be more difficult.
??
is ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/*up.wav'' still inaudible?
no such file or directory. i wonder how i've don this
err, you're using ubuntu, correct?
ya
and you don't have a /usr/share/sounds/ directory?
for a epson prefection v30 scanner
ok, what filename do you have?
what do you mean
what is the filename you downloaded?
esci-interpreter-gt-f720_0.0.12. I also have [URL]b
ok then run: cd ~/Downloads; sudo dpkg -i ./[URL]b
My wireless doesn.t work anymore
give details
That's what I assumed =) Darn.  fedora core 6 came with 1 click setup of fglx and compiz =(
Interesting. Pretty sure I'd rather have the radeon driver though...
I'd just like the convenience of having my video card choice not be a big deal. =)
That's be nice. We can hope, and send letters to ATI. :)
Bummer. brb
as it sounds like it's not looking in the usual place, so you have to supply a parameter with it in?
yeah it's funny. sudo apt-get remove Windows\ XP
nice
fx 3.6 =firefox?.  i'm a lilttle confused as there appear ot be a couple adobe flash plugins..  i usually abbreviate it to ff for firefox, yea got 3.6.8 here also running lucid and running the non-free version of flash here too
fx is the abreviation acording to the wiki ;)
ok.  looking in synaptic I see two. I have installed flashplugin-installer and flashplugin-nonfree 10.1.53 but there is another one called adobe-flashplugin 10. What is the difference?
adobe-flashplugin is from partner repos i belive, flashplugin-nonfree is actualy empty (it can be removed with no priblems) and redirects to install flashplugin-installed
i'm confused. I should also ask whether your is a 32 or 64-bit system install. Maybe this makes adifference to flash working for paltalk express or not?
myne is 32bit. mine*
ok, same here, so, why not working here? mystery.  hardware?
are you sure you don't have another plugin for flash installed <unconvertable> like swfdec or gnash
positive...
no idea then
i'm not the only one. most peoples flash crashes when they try to run paltalk express. apparently its got issues running under linux.  i do have swfdec-gnome installed yes
and swfdec-mozilla <unconvertable>
do you know how to fix it ?
use metacity. or find a good gtk 2.x theme. I use a greyhound theme works great
what about emerald
I don't use emerald
yeap.
Skype has not been released, as far as I know, with 64-bit.... have to use a work-around to install and get it running.  do you have nvidia vid card?
I tried that. =/
are you using xmms or anything?
i got this from iotop
You got what?
the line i pasted nothing more
Do you get that when you run the program or while setup of iotop
on the startup of ubuntu
I was talking about the "too much hard disk access". iotop is the program to find out which process is doing the hd access...
in iotop the command that take too much access is the one i pasted
Hmm..
yes
Try starting GDM
is empty...
Try your ifuse command.
I successfully mounted it with "mount /dev/hda -t fuse.ifuse /media/iphone", the problem now is that my system seemsto don't like it
Why is that?
so?
so you want to brute force a checksum ?
i already did that, on my nvidia card
or is it an md5 password ?
a password obvously
search the repos for the tool you want then
-_-.  we both know these things aren't in ubuntu's repository
then it's offtopic for this channel
unless i'd want that tool to be added to the repo
even then it's offtopic, you'd need to log a feature request
fine, fine, nobody has the answer, got it
ok
this isn't hoary problem...
then I don't understand what's gone wrong
system i want use in English
which language is the second you need to set?
can i chage like regional setings like on WIndows second is Latvian
yes, i think on the sam place where you have setted your prefered one. let me have a look on my system
[URL]  any help would be appreciated much
does gedit or firefox give you that error message?
but the pid that gets registered is the pid of the shell not the process i want to kill. so stop deamon doesnt work
without going into bash script here, a simple test is: my-script & then echo echo $! should render the correct pid. just echo $! .. not echo echo
mp3
do you have lame installed?
yes.  looks like a bug
do you have the other plugins used by the mp3 gstreamer pipe installed?
[URL]
i believe there was a id3mux one or something
ah, i see
those plugins are contained within different packages...make sure you get the multiverse versions also to make sure you get the complete collection. it should work
yeah, thanks. installing gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse got it working. seems like a bug that the UI shows impossible things though
it's slick from here out though ;)
I am dual boot and when I go back to the dark side I can't access my recent downloads
Tell me more about your disk layout.
checking. okay, looks like they do. banshee, and movie player both work. VLC does not. nor does any sort of mp3 conversion software
looks like you have some missing dependencies for vlc
audacity also cannot open the file
open vlc in terminal, it should display error in the background
which is what I'm really trying to do.  no error in background when run from terminal
tough cookie. SoundConverter runs on top of gstreamer, so it will convert to mp3 as needed. But it does not solve the problem. Is it only specific mp3s, or all of them?
<unconvertable> <unconvertable> man lsof???
yes, read manual of lsof (list open files)
ok. ty
np
what do you mean with pae?
sorry misread; you are compiling your own kernel then
yes..pogo games is a website, and yes I can get online, but when in try to go into a game room, it says it can't connect
doesn't work for me either, its using java applets, i think that could be related to the problem
is there anything that i can do about it??
do you have sun-java6-jre installed?
i've tried installing and reinstalling java, but i'm never sure if it works or not...the test never works, but never says it didn't work either
one moment, checking something
No, I have a Imac G3, and you ?
i was just wondering if it was truly 64-bit, or they labeled it so
To check, I suppose trying to make a fc4 ppc64 should fail on a 32 bits machine
we are both behind the times http://ftp.uni-[URL]
great
i'm readin up on fc4 and i see a lot of "you need to pursuade x.program to run on your G5". lot of "this 'should' work on your G5 now".  i'd stick with ubuntu
I will do that too. I am switching from yellowdog to ubuntu
that's good. ydl is good, but for the RPMs.. .... <gagh>
yum does its job Honestly, but the packages are old
i had more trouble compiling my own stuff/installing. I just found ydl to be more pain than pleasure
so i just have to edit the grub config?
yes.
same here. can't load the kernel module for you either?
no didnt we discuss the new X 7.1?3.  and that u think u have a strange problem
oh, I solved that!!!
did u ever contact ATi?.  what was it ?
remember I got the 2D only driver to work at least? well, that one started getting fickle on me too.
yes yes tell me more
can I do the opposite/. ?
yes.. i have one running at home.. installed server without gui, then installed ubuntu-desktop
Ok, thanks man
no problem, server has some nice extra features i thought, like supporting the service command the way redhat/centos/fedora uses it :). that's 8.10 server though
consider i want to compile my own toolbox in C++ and i need to use non-header only boost includes.
I still don't see the point - the binary has the same ABI (SysV x86-64) regardless of the compiler, so you can link against boost with your favorite compiler
yea. the php file
is that public server?
ok I'll check it out.. SystemD seems like a real winner with all these commands. So much simpler.. #newStuffIsNew but still #simpleCommandsAreBetter. ok so... if I want to diagnose "failed to load: no such file or directory" should I start at /etc/init/$job or is that just there to tease me, and the systemD files are somewhere else?
I'm not sure, but there is an entire channel just for #systemd, if that helps.
sure there is, that's how it checks for changes on upgrades
What's "it"?
dpkg, it says "conf file changed, install new/show diff/etc.". you know those prompts?
Ah, in a deb package.
As in to switch drives. I have two CD Drives and I want to use the other one for Ubuntu
oh....i dunno, i think it checks all your cdroms, doens' tit?
so i must type xchat in command ?. oh ok ;)
make the session just run xchat. :) you are trying too hard.
it doesn't make sense as to why my laptop does not have pyneighborhood installed and system-config-samba works great, yet my htpc needed it installed to work.
perhaps taking a bit more time researching it might give you more answers, and looking at the sourceforge site you could possibly look at what packages it depends on and figure why.
because you left to fast tehre was more.  are you in ubuntu?
gnomeFreak: sorry, dual boot, I have to reboot into linux to try advice.
grab pen and paper
gnomeFreak: no, in windowsxp. gnomeFreak: got them
do you have an onboard videocard. brb
replaced it with the new agp nvidia. It is disabled completely. gnomeFreak: replaced it with the new agp nvidia. It is disabled completely.
did nvidia-glx install ok?
gnomeFreak: yes it completed without error
ok in terminal type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade when you finished writing that let me know
gnomeFreak: i have tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver but it gives me an error "x-server not loaded"
we havent gotten there yet
gnomeFreak: I'll try those and be right back
nope :/
command_not_found_handle() will get executed when a command is not found by bash
yeah, bur I don't know what to do next
check that the file exists and call gnome-open on it
yeah, but how :/
google for "advanced bash scripting guide".  and [URL] tells you how the command-not-found program uses it
it calls home, whip out ethereal and watch
i dont believe your bs
Wow! Nice one!
;).  you can play sounds too!
Ye, I know to play with notify-send.. :p.. just didn't know about the sleep command..  You sir are awesome, and made my day today. ;) byebyez
thanks.
does it? it does not explain why all my irc clients use ipv6 when i tell them to connect to [URL]
oh, IDK it might be choosing ipv6 over ipv4. I"m not sure.

Youre welcome.
how do you suppose where...I just need some assisstance..
1.) efnet server is not an invite server 2.) this channel supports ubuntu not "invites to different IRC networks"
I was just hoping someone is in here connected to the same server..
I'm connected to it, but I don't see how that changes anything based on the information I've just given you
so that one can be of assisstance...  : How bout you just give some appropriate suggestions about the same..
1.) it's not an invite only server 2.) this channel supports ubuntu, not efnet
yes its given by dhcp. but its the wrong
If that's the case, you will need to configure the DHCP server to assign that particular IP to that box.
i cat it flashed up one the screen. its not a log file
-> can you post in pastebin that error?
they got their market - servers - right?. darn :/
heh.  i moved from debian to ubuntu-server
it worked better than debian? ;P
the defaut configuration options were far too sane and the packages far too up-to-date for me to NOT do that.  i'm running a prerelease of dapper on my ubuntu-server machine, and it's *great*. I've had zero problems with it once i got it installed
i'm running dapper as desktop OS right now, and i've had no probs
I had a problem with the installer when I tried to use XFS as the root filesystem. but apparently XFS and grub don't always get along, from what i've heard. I'm using a 3ware hardware RAID 1 card too. everything has worked very well. all problems i've had on that machine have been PEBKAC. heh
the only problem i got is apt-getting build-dep wine
i find the fconsole much more friendly than a gui. but to each his own. the console and the unix filesystem are *largely* consistent. or the variation is within a very limited range. "help might be -h or it might be -?, sometimes it's just --help". "and usually all 3 will work, but not always". subtle stuff like that. there are non-standard console apps that do weird stuff, of course, but in general, it's great
does anyone agree with me about my thing for the extra repO?
jonathaN, it rocks jonathan!!!. jonathaN, welcome aboard ;-))). I love their philosophy..I hope they can maintain it. agreed. much easier setup with all the benefits ;-)
I downloaded ubuntu-8.10-desktop-[URL]o
this is going into the vm?
Hi Brian! I presed shift several times and my keyboard got locked. I want to unlockk it. Any idea?. Brian98: I can't use my keybord under Ubuntu, it's locked. No output!
even after restart?. does the mouse work
Brian98 Yes. Brian98 It saved the setting I guess
if you hit alt F1 do you get a terminal. alt f7 to get back to gui. ctrl-alt f1. I mean
Brian98 I could get terminal by using the mouse.
can you try that. ctrl-alt f1
Actually, the first time I formatted it in the Wii :( So windows can't even recognize it.
Tgp1994 depending upon whether that flash card is legit or not, and when I say that is that I recieved a Kingston 64 gig flash and it was fake card. It works great but Windows was not able to format it. That was a problem, but I fixed it though.
If the Wii can format it though, shouldn't it be legit?
It depends.. Did you try to format the card in Linux?
And I mean with the homebrew file browser, I can browse it, but that's something else. I'm just concerned about linux recognizing it. ACTually, I wouldn't mind if I could just reset the FS..  Ya, I don't know how, I don't know the device ID.
Tgp1994 see if your Linux box can see the device.
thanks
so what method are you trying to use?
i've done it before but it's not working this time, ..  I have openssh-server installed... generated keys.
you'll need to be more specific than that, please.
?
or.. do you have accelerated graphics driver working?

dcc
^^
dcc -h. -?. -h
are you using irssi?
sorry i meant Ctrl+F ofcourse
then hit <F3> for next result?. What movie player are you talking about exactly?
running what via sudo?
Well yes. But did you log out and back in again after setting up the group?.  THe script
like with differnt programs/folders
ah i see. i don't know. it may be possible with kde 4.2, but i doubt it's possible w/ gnome
Isnt that app for just listening to mp3s?
no audacious is the xmms-like player for listening to mp3s.  audacity is for sound editing
what do u mean
it's all *'s, it isn't set to run
shouldnt that run every minute ?
no. use */1 * * * *
didnt work. did not run
check /var/log/syslog
/var/log/syslog is empty

I use thunar-comes with xfce4-panel, mousepad, epiphany, conky
nope generate a deb back
you mean yiu installed via a .deb deleted the deb. and now you want the .deb back...
feora. fedora*
dpkg is more of a behind the scenes thing (kinda sorta); use synaptic and apt-get to do your package management
what ever is the latest in the repo, i believe 3.0rc1
wants to know the differnence between SCIM and Keyboard layout ( which lets you type in ur language of choice). hmm @ .  this is rather weird.  did you try re-installing the package ?
okay- so I think its unmount the windows drive- then mount \media\hda1 -ro ?
sounds about right. Also, change the "default" option by "noauto" in /etc/fstab
I see, thanks a lot
you're welcome
not yet in fact I never heard of it.  I'll give it a shot, thanks for the suggestion
np, I hopes thats the correct name : )
well I found something by that name so it probably is
ya, I just checked too
So "no".
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk (or jre)
Is the package on the CD?
no, because its not free, but maybe openjdk is on cd
does the Audigy 2 have an on-board mixer?
I think so
i also have hoary, but no cdrom group?
cat /etc/group|grep cdrom
under System > Administration > Users and Groups > .. you mean, right?
yup.  double click on the user and there should a ckeckbox for access to cdrom drives on one of the tabpages
cdrom:x:24:hal,nora,arjan
*checkbox
so yeah, I have rights on cdrom (I'm arjan)
you have a group cdrom
8.0 r99
That's gnash. Youtube hates that :p
is it possible to remove gash?. or replacei t. replace it*
Indeed, I would first go into Synaptic and see if you can uninstall gnash from there.
ok, thanks, hasn't come up yet but now i know it's there.
dapper?
breezy, i broke my install trying to upgrade a few days ago.
its not in breezy repos afaik
ah, ok
apt-cache search azureus in term9inal see if it finds it
ok, i'm not gettting anything.
its not in breezy repos i didnt think it was but i had you check anywya
[URL] "The package compiles and installs into the kernel tree. "
does it setsid the build process and run them separately? because this is the process tree: [URL]
more subtile would be: unpacks and configures
where does the unattended upgrader log to?. found it, but no indications why the process is hanging. Can I kill it?. When I killed the plymouth --ping process, then dkms proceeded building. Until plymouth --ping is run again. Kill it and then it works a little bit longer. New plymouth, kill it, and so on. Eventually the apt unattended upgrader finishes successfully
do NTP servers respond using NTP protocol? even on specifying an HTTP URL?. oh wait-it's not an HTTP URL sorry  :). so that's the issue eh-NTP is blocked? any workarounds?
my guess is they block by ports, so you could try to find a ntp server running on port 80
Thanks again mate.
i'm not sure if the ms office stuff will work through wine... its got some deep hooks into the windows OS. star office is another one to check out
ok
also since you are already a root, you do not require "sudo". -a
oh ok. it says i cannot remove a directory
you forgot to use the -r argument
?. can i have an exampel code. for that use
im very worried if you dont know the RM command but are logged in somewhere as root.. anyway, rm -r /path/to/folder
I beleive thats for syslogd. not rsyslogd. hm, maybe so
i could be wrong. certianly changes wouldn't take effect until rsyslog is restarted.
what is the dvd format?
what format is it in... and can you dvd player play avis?
i have a movie on MPEG-4
vob files
yeah I checked the iso with the MD5. IdeOne, I'm trying to install the server edition on a dell poweredge 6450.  but the installation stops when it trys to mount the CDROM and says. it needs a release file??
I am not real certain what that error means. I'm sorry I can't be much help
thanks, I remember devilspie now
:)
can't find anything about it on Ubuntu website... probably me who is blind though :p.  ok, will do
!info Gajim. !info Gajim hardy
xpiozion, look over at [URL] iirc. it has the compatability lists
thanks im on it
i only have the address not the ip
works as well ;)
see thats the problem its been working fine for past few months even after i reintsall but this time wont work
So an aready added printer stopped working?
i had to reinstall ubuntu yesterday.  i have this problem
SpiritsInside: Try rsh? (shell for ftp/scp users, blocks other commands)
last time i installed printer i had to use proprietary drivers with the sudo dpkg -i --architecture force command.  this is 64 bit
I don't know your printer model so my help is limite(and I'm short on time) but try to do it from CUPS web interface as stated earlier and give it the IP to the printer?
what is cups
Maybe you might need a multi-lib or chrooted version to use the driver which is probably 32bits?.  Cups = Printing backed for MOST linux systems, can be accessed from http://127.0.0.1:631
what is the sudo force command again??
sudo just runs a command as root.. (when placed in the first part of the command)
yeah i got 2 .deb files which are 32 bit.  but
I don't remember the dpkg commands at the moment and don't have the time to look that up..
is that /query?
yes
on boot up
go on.......
Ok, well I was installing LAMP using a package and it started uninstalling ubuntu desktop, so I (foolishly) crashed out and now i only have command line access. I am using live cd at the mo
run: sudo apt-get -f install.  you can remove ubuntu-desktop package, it is a metapackage only
the main problem is that i no longer have connection to the repos
you may still be able to run the command
I've been using aptitude and can identify teh missing packages, but get the 'temporarily unavailable' error. Yep I've tried that command - no joy
then use a wired connection and it should be ok
Thank you, none then ;)
you dont shutdown with a normal user?
I use NX for outside my network, but inside my network I use Mac clients and want to make user of the built-in VNC "share screen" buttons in Finder.. Unsurprisingly "use NX" is the only response anyone ever seems to get to this question. It's not what I asked.
yeah that probably won't work, VNC used by Apples Remote Desktop is very very adapted and proprietary
yes :(
Has it been this way from the beginning, what caused it do you know?
no, it was working okay for several months, it started happening few days ago
Make a new user and see if it is the same there.
okay.  it doesn't work on other account
Hmm, we have had kernel updates lately, have you tried an earlier kernel from the grub menu?
no.. should this help?
It's hard to say, some info that may of caused it would help me, I have to some what guess since you are getting some of the web page.
im talking about, the text on the window of an application like this " * Firefox - Mozilla - [] x"
the alignment of that text is determined by your window border theme
you know any window border theme, with left window text?
how is it aligned now?
its in the middle
one example is 'Mist', but it is very plain; you should be able to edit your current theme
ive ended partitioning with gparted and it shows i have 4 warnings. or i can skip it?

SOMAXCONN is set at 128 but my understanding is that only affects the size of the backlog.  I can't seem to track down the magic number that governs it
referer [URL]maxconn (/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn).  What process is being limited? some executables (php for example) may have the limit hard-coded
and pass?
Not set
xm. i tried that but nothing
Damaged disc/iso often render such results. I suggest you download the ISO via torrents (and stay away from ktorrent, it does funny stuff), make sure the disc burns at a low speed and is verified after burn.
xar: I have the procedure down... more curious about any common gotchas associated with pulling a drive out while the system is on. I'm sure people have hosed things up pretty good before
I usually don't hot pull unless it's enterprise grade hardware; can you not shut it down?
[thor] ok. [thor] can u tell me how to do that?
there are no exe files in linux
how can i do that
telnet {ip} {port}
just thought someone would know off hand
we do know. and its not this week
thanks.. i perfer 7zip over the archive manager. i used it in windows and i think its awesome
the ubuntu version is command line
i'm not sure
are you typing modprobe?
no, it's autoloadding on boot I suppose.  for AC97
take a look at the files in /etc/modprobe.d/ ... they contain some good examples, ... then create an empty file in that directory, maybe "local" and add a corresponding options line
adobe flash missing my lubuntu. what is installed it?
what is the output of: uname -m ?
woot! thank you . Is there any way to fix teh kernel module system before I do that?
Not sure, I've never tried on ubuntu to mess with the kernel's internals
thanks  for the response. i assume though that the OS partition should be primary type though right?
no, works with logical too
thanks man.  is that usr/local/RealPlay or RealPlayer
either, really.
how do I know that?
do you have the beryl icon in your tray? the gem thingy next to the clock?
no next to the clock I do have the volume and then internet and then normal software such gaim. How do I do that?
Go to System Tool in the menu and start the beryl-manager.
OK. It is the configurations... and now?
if you started the Beryl Manager there should be the try icon i was talking about.
nop...
If you do not have the beryl manager. do 'sudo apt-get install beryl-manager'
I have the beryl manager, I can see "Beryl Setting Manager" but I open it and I can change configs, but I do not see the difference and neither the icon
Setting Manager and Beryl Manager are two differnet things
oh....  I will do the one that you told me then.  OK. I see a red diamond there
right click on it - go to Select Windows Man. and chose Beryl.  if you dont want to use it anymore switch back to Metacity
I want to try this experimental multitouch driver: [URL] I already compiled and installed it, but I can't make my system use it
I want to say the latest version of X had multitouch support, I..thought
program call xfprot. i know i downloaded it. i think the problem is that i need KDE ?? -- maybe I dont know?
Where are you getting it and is it packaged for Ubuntu and is it a deb?
no its a tar.gz. [URL]
Are you trying to scan windows files for viruses?
no. i can scan fine.. but wanted the GUI
Are you afraind of viruses in linux?
no
afraid
afraid of mail viruses. but still why cant I run it.. its bugging me
But you understand there is no need for antivirus in Linux/ubuntu
I know ... but my main point is that I cant run the program?. because of GTK runtimes
It is best to stay in the official repos expecially if you are new to linux.  YOu are running into a dependency problem.. to fix it you must install the required pieces that will make your package work.
I tryed jack. I run the dev GTK installed the Lib -- but the only runtimes I can find is in win32
If you go outside the official repos to install the dependencies you stand a good chance of messing things up during an update or upgrade.
I am trying to connect to a remote desktop that is not on a local network
I meant to send that message to someone else
and how do I do that?
Well, if you really waned to you could add .desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications this is not a hoary bug. the support for menu editing changing is being fixed in gnome
I see, thanks guys
not really a bug either..just no gui for ityet
necrophcor, wanted to have the latest version ..
well the error is pretty clear, but i'm not sure which version of boost you're using?
it means update manager doesn't work
what do these command show. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade pastebin all of the info
[URL] for update, and i dont want to run upgrade
The upgrade is important to see, it will only show what ca be upgraded and you have a yes or no to run it.
ah right, so you can still get the info if i hit no
yeah
yes
care to pastebin it?
and i disabled the one in the modem.  just a sec

video. Also, how do I direct a comment at someone like you just did ?
<> what about memory setting? not a lot?
the run dialog (alt+f2) is gnome-panel
yeah, you mean something like an applet that only runs while gnome-panel is up eh? well, if thats the case, i can't use it- but then i'll have to figure out whether i can use fbrun to pass a url to gnome-open
2 days before it was working without it
maybe you/updates have changed the policy
yes I know. Thats something of gnome then, not reading the profile
yeah, because you've already logged in, via gdm, so starting a terminal isn't a login, see?
i know. Im just used to fvwm. There i did my settings + login in runlever 3 and did a startx from bash_profile
jools: pretty much all *dm variants work that way. er,  that was
I know, but I don't know where else to ask. People are experienced here, so i though somebody might know

what is blinking? the big do not disconnect sign?
the ipod itself
awesome, i love you guys
when you put it in your computer the live cd comes up..and an option to install
but will I be able to restore it all ?. of course I shouldn't do the windows backup thing,but actually a manual backup in which I choose the files I want to keep
Yes. Linux can read FAT and NTFS partitions. And yes, copy the files, not windows backup.
yeah... that is a good solution... but it's not the first time... i wanna try finding out the root of the problem... so no ideas?
sorry :)
i would like to setup webserver on my ubuntu.. but i need portforwarding for that.. plz help
it's not a ubuntu question. ubuntu doesn't do the forward, your router does. [URL] or such
so where's the best place for the solution #ubuntu-offtopic ?
possible. also #networking. but not here
thanks
and support multiple processors and more RAM (+4GB or something like that?)
d?
e.g. find / -name '*thingtosearch*'
hmm its still just kind of sitting. how long should it take to find a folder?
look at your disk LED. haha i was totally gonna call it as Elantech. lo
marko:even i too facing that problem.
driving me mad. anyone know how to setup efi partition for dual boot?
i need a tutorial. =).  where?
where what?
i'm searching a tutorial about image analize. do you know about it?
[URL]
ya, no one is responding... so I'm advertising here!!! heehehe
sort of defeats the object of not asking in here.  just wait around in there
thanks, but the connection would be through the msn server or the LAN? Should i make another profile?
msn
../some/dir/i/try/point/to <- does that work?
".." means "parent directory"
to start look from root again i mean. i know it does, but does it work if you build on it. it did
use a variable set to the starting point. E.g. BASE="root"; ls "$ROOT/current-path $ROOT/some/dir/i/try/point/to"
hmm thats smart thanks
but use the same variable name, ignore my bad example!
it hangs at boot i cant get in. what are those shortcuts called that drop me to a lower level
look up emergency bash shell
thats it. thanks
np
can you link me?
Raja: using a liveCD?
thanks <3
!flash | adlisyakir.  no problem :)
when createing the user?
yes.  or with usermod or another account info modifier
so something like useradd user -d user
-d /home/user
what about -m?
that will make the home directory if ir doesn't exist already. *it
hmmm, type useradd user -d /home/user -p password. it creates the user but wont accept the password?. grrrr, I am still getting No Directory logging in with home
use useradd user -d /home/user -m -p password
anywhere. well wait.  yea everywhere
did you use the volumecontrol and configure it?. pavucontrol
yea. well from the sound preferences.. trying that one now.  in pavucontrol on output devices it shows audio playing (the moving audio bar for sound levels) but nothing is playing through the speakers.. on configuration its set to 'Analog Stero Duplex' which is what it was always set to when it worked
try typing pulseaudio ---start
doesnt seem to have an effect. there was no output from the command. so no error
idk.  alsamixer
meh, not for 16.04
"Linux user"?. didn't even know they had their own channel, too
yeah, but the au mirror is down *again*, and it breaks the install when it times out.
choose a different time zone for the install, then when its done fix your time
: so how do i use ftp when it says no route to host
what command are you using exactly
what is that ?
Sorry, just: ssh [insert url without brackets]
I know that, but what do you mean ?
To log in, you would have to have those privileges on your account.
I know but I am unable to connect from outside my local network as root.
Did you try su or sudo?
as sudo ssh ?
Yes, or just plain sudo.
not haven't tried it. are you sure about that ?
No, but it doesn't hurt to try.
the point is it doesn't make sense what you are saying.
Are you trying to login to ssh?
i installed OO by myself, becaus the package in hoary was bad
yeah, same here. remove it before upgrading
awesome thanks
you're welcome
how do i go back to original?

what's gnustep?
i think it's select active window.  see [URL].  is like mac os x cocoa API
no, it's not select active window.  am i supposed to use windowmaker with gnustep now?
no, you can use wmaker completely fine without gnustep
ah, focus next window
it's just they fit well together
I installed xorg-driver-fglrx and updated my [URL]nf file. 3d acceleration isn't working (still) and oowriter won't start now
does hw accel work now?
No. I try to start it and I see a whole lot of "API ERROR"s. "[fglrx] API ERROR: could not register entrypoint for GenerateMipmapEXT" <--I see a lot like this
are you starting it from the terminal?
Yes. To see what the problem is. It looks like a problem with the graphics driver. I want 3d to work, though, and it doesn't with the regular ati driver. It doesn't work with this one either, though
what card is it?
Radeon 9200
the free drivers for it are supposed to be good.. or maybe I'm thinking of the 9100 or something else
just the loopback. If I run an ifconfig I see all interfaces I should have (eth0, 1 and 2.
are you using network manager to manage your network interfaces? and what are your interfaces?
Apparently 8.10 doesn't like when you manually edit the network config. Found that out the hard way and started using the network manager GUI..  yes. Eth0, eth1 and eth2.
no, the network manager is just finiky, I usually uninstall it right off the bat :).  all three are ethernet connections?
But as I said... soon as I reboot, I get a second eth2 under the network manager..  Yes
does ifconfig show the extra eth2?
At the moment, no. Because I usually delete the second eth2 on start-up since I need eth0 as primary.
just to make sure I'm understanding right, the computer has 3 network interfaces, on boot you get eth0, eth1, eth2, eth2?
Yes.. Leave a message. I screen calls.
How can we be sure you're not a man?
my bad, but this was the specifications on my soundcard
I assume you wanted to give that to me, but why? also you put sebastien
huh!. !MAAS. [URL]

Shall i consider it as joke?
i thought it was a db used for industry, same name, wrong on my end
on my way! Thanks!

I have an issue when switching between systems with my trackball over a kvm switch, I use that to reset it.. NOt sure if it will work, but simple enough to try

no results...
find kqemu. !find kqemu. !find kqemu.ko.  [URL]  no kqemu anymore
> Already did that
say didnt work?
No it doesnt windows 7 only occupies 50% of the harddrive
well from what i recall there are some options on the install, something like use entire disk is one and custom partition is another, so i think there is an option before you get to that screen where you can choose to do it another way
ok ill have a look. there is an option for 'something else' which is what I am doing. then it brings up the list of hard drives and it just shows the entire hard drive and not the windows parititions
something else is the one but something is wrong there, whenever i have used it. it can see the partitions there and i can do stuff with them
hmm not sure what do to. to do*
cant think, anyone have any suggestions for  ?.  well i am not sure why the screen is showing you no partitions if there are partitions there, are you sure there are partitions?
no gpu load
and how are you monitoring that? with what command?
aticonfig --odgc --adapter=all
Thanks, I didn't know ati had such a tool. What bandwidth are we talking about? localhost? gigabit? fast ethernet?
nivekcl: this on a laptop?
no desktop.  it is a desktop with an intel cpu and gigabyte motherboard if that matters
nivekcl: the 2.6.30 kernel is unsupported, but i recommend it
how would i go about upgrading to that then?
you did the 32bit install right?
yes
nivekcl: [URL]
thank you
that's very little right? why does 300mhz needed per client?. 300mhz * 100 = 30Ghz?! what kind of cpu is that?. does it really need so much power?
seems little, but enough for pxe..  100 pxe clients on one server, have you ever seen that?
not 30Ghz right? cpu poewr.  cybercafe?.  student campus computers?
that would be more than one server, i am sure.
okay ;)
have you downloaded the Catalyst driver for it?
yep ;)
and it's still not working?
uhm :(. graphic card is okay
alright, try this
It was fine for 500+ days before I went to 8.04. 512 meg.  If I power cycle how can do a post mortem?
i've no idea, maybe mmm booting into that "safe mode" or what ever you call it.  i guess it's not useful advice but that's the first thing that comes to mind for me
should have been more specific ... scripting languages ... perl, python, ruby, etc.
web scripting or shell scripting?
i'm having issues with it. what's happening is that i try to convert an AVI but I get the error "conversion failed, make sure you have enough disk space?"
Keep in mind, it has to create a cache folder, for temporary use. Make sure you have at least about 12GB free.
i've got a 300 gig harddrive. I'm pretty sure there's something else going on that I can't quite figure out
I have a 500GB hard drive, and something was telling me I was out of space-- Actually check it and see how much space you have. Other than that, I've never had an issue with it.
sdb1
no, what folder?
mecha25: could I make a folder within my sdb1?. mecha25: scratch that, I can't
sdb1 is a hard-drive device, not a place you can send files to. I'm confused, what exactly are you trying to transfer
they're supposed to be synchronized
not really
even if not i added em manually
it depends were/how you have told it to authenticate
i managed to get asked on entering folder
being prompted is not the same as sucessfully authenticating correclty
im authenticated in net use. and can go into folder
you're not.  as you can't write.  so either a.) your permissions are wrong b.) your not authenticated
I'll check..  Intel 82801F High Definition Audio Controller
You need to set up Timidity++ then
err yeah 4318
you rebooted, right?
sn9: yeah
and the firmware was installed?
sn9: i installed the fwcutter but it didnt work do i need to find some windows driver too?
when it asked to fetch, did you say yes, or no?
tried to stop, and start , no effect.  it's server, no network manager.  and no silly configs, pretty standard
so then stop should be pretty obvious if it works...
[URL]
let me read it..
yeah. it isnt there
what do you mean with the terminal? please?
i have the root terminal but the regular terminal is like gone
just run a terminal, alt-f2 and run "xterm" or "gnome-terminal"
I always forget the syntax some weirdnes seith &2> i recall. with... [URL] command 2>&1 >/dev/null
Ah found it 2>&1
hi, i tried that, but it does it for the whole interface i think.  i want per ip based.  and it doesn't have any options for that :/
Are you using Ubuntu as a NAT for several other computers and you want to limit individual hosts to certain up/down rates?
i am connected via putty, i am trying to expand my disk.  i get mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member' when i try to mount sda5
oh it's LVM, i have no experience with that stuff. expand via SSH'ing in? hah, is it a VPS or something? or a physical system near you?
its a vm running on esxi and yea the physical esxi host is near me
so why don't you boot it with live media and perform this task from there? :)
you mean run ubuntu's iso ?
sure
and what do i do there?. is there a tutorial or something ?
you can use graphical partitioning tools. maybe, have a look
I don't have mplayer installed. will try that.  fails with "Error selecting VCD track. (get) Failed to open vcd://1."
so try 2 -- vcd://2
failed with same error except the track number
are you sure it's a vcd?
I want to see it, but just a bit thinner. I guss that's not really an option then?. *guess
you can try looking in gconf-editor
capable of handling HUGE log files?
yes, it is also distributed.
ok, cause I've got a cache thats doing a thousand hits a second. thats dumping its log files to a processing box every hour
splunk works the same way; you have an agent, that dumps the logs to central server, where you query them from the web.. check it out.
is this in synaptic package?
yes
thank you
or you could sudo apt-get install wifi-radar
but for the whole system?
sudo find / -lname somepattern <-- maybe
i will try. thx
nope try this sudo find / -type l <-- that is closer
I want that fc-cache scans only the folder .fonts in my home, not all the home folder.  obviously I have other fonts in the home folder, but I don't want to install them
mm I have not had this issue with regenerating font cache
It's the first time for me also
are you doing suod fc-cache -fv.  you could try sudo fc-cache (nameof directory)
I did sudo fc-cache -fv and had the problem, than sudo fc-cache -r (rescan)
try nameing the directory only with that...also there is a perfect application named font-manager,, that deals with fonts nicely makeing it possible to disable fonts on the fly.  man fc-cache doesn't have a whole lot of info associated with this however
it's very stange anyway.  I've installed font so many times and never had similar issues
yes it sounds so... as I said ,, I have not had this issue ,, ,I deal with fonts all the time,,.  it is odd.  unless the fc-cache "name of directory" command would be helpful
I used the command and it effectively loaded only that folder.  but I cannot manage to reset my actual cache
well that's a start :).  mmm
I'll try the ultimate resource... rebooting.  it works more than expected
i believe the clear font cache command is fc-cache -rv
AMX-ITGuy: the version of kernel you mean?
kernel and version of Ubuntu
3.0.0-15 generic (?) and 11.10
anything special about your mouse? tried a different usb port?
I also have the log opened saying SIGSEGV, but I'm afraid I can't paste it :/.  tried both different ports and mice
what desktop env?
a weird, strange, mixed up env from Gnome, Unity, KDE, Xfce and LXDM :D.  using LXDM mainly, but it's sometimes showing all together :/
ah, so a "standard" env? lol - if you try something more generic without 3d acceleration (gnome 2, unity 2d, etc) does the issue still occur?
how long?
depends on how busy the mirror is and how fast your internet connection isn't
whats it doing? checking mirror on site?
something apt-get related. I forget what exactly =/
ok well...i guess ill wait

my ubuntu 14.04 was crashing when i play cs ssource, i have nvida card.  the system freezes, an happen nvidia fallen off us. bus.  i uninstalled virtualbox, and the crash disapeared
ah-har, perhaps virtualbox's kernel modules were interfering somehow.  did you try different nvidia driver versions to see if it still happened with all of them?
yes. I chroot'd.  and mounted /proc prior to
did you mount bind /dev ?
no, only /proc
you need /dev /dev/pts and /sys
yay. thanks  once again.  do I need /proc ?
yeah
i/o for hdc, but the cdrom worked when i was installing gentoo. but could that have been because of the netinstall from the livecd?
is hdc the cd?
yeah. im putting in a new ide cable now. ive put in a new cdrom
- just a sec

[URL] that will keep you from having to restart the install
: i want to disable address resolution protocol in my linux box but i dont know how to do this
arp is very low in ethernet I'm not sure you can go much lower everything seems to link into the mac address that I think is part of arp
?
/j #ubuntu-br.  This is english only channel
I tried 'mount /dev/sdb1' and it cant find it in fstab or mtab why?
your command is imcomplete - unless you got a fstab entry for it..  mount /dev/whatever /media/makeadir
how does it goes so far?
too buggy
where are u getting errors?
no nvidia GL, nautilus sometimes crashes...
I'm making it, but I haven't found the answer.
[URL]
so I have to read the whole book? great
Well, it'll give you a better uderstanding of what's goig on..  Right now, you're kind of saying: "I want to fly a jet plane, but I don't know how to turn the engines on, can someone do that for me and I'll take over in the air?"
yeah sure.. great help
De nada, vago.
its probably a coincidence that the same ports are open
do you want me to screenshot that for you?
of what. i can sense you're getting annoyed lol.  if you open up routers port 80 to the world, port 80 would show up on an internet scan, if you only open it to lan, it wont.  if you scan from a lan address itll show up
no not at all, I am not annoyed, I was trying to understand you
but what im saying is, if you have a pc with lan address 192.168.1.123 and router has port, say 8118 forwarded to it, port 8118 wont show up if you scan 192.168.1.1 from 192.168.1.123.  as the router isnt the one listening on that address. *poty. port*. lol
Now I get it. You were talking about local machine ports Versus ISP ip address ports. Then of course you won't get same ports I know that. I thought some else
basically if youre doing port scan on your router (looking for open ports) its not gona show ports being forwarded. as you are looking "up" to a single device rather then "down" from the internet at several devices
Why do some people forward some ports? To avoid conflicts?.  or to hide open ports?
#drupal-support
edit your XChat's Network List, for the networks concerned, and set the Character set to UTF-8
any... I just needed the RE
well, if you're using, say, grep, you just match on locale and throw the -v flag
like grep -v .*locale.* ?
just grep -v locale
what would I do if I wanted the line to be exacly locale, then?
what? oh, nothing else on the line?
oh, thank you. I hope it helps
how many languages you have in ibus-setup
I suppose two. Russian and English
the top one creates issues, ie won't launch?
no, it's just when I type something it changes language every next letter and it goes something like that "smtig lk ht"
my ibus is acting very strangely as well, identical setup. I'll check launchpad for bugs
maybe you know if it's possible to use [URL]nf for configuring layouts in maverick.  I was unable to type when I tried to add keyboard stuff into there
does ibus-setup let you change
it told me that ibus is turned off.  is that because I pressed ctrl+space.  anyway, it works after pressing ctrl+space just fine
what about alt f2 ibus-setup , should launch a configuration wizard
thank you very much
okay
i did all of it...
I'm seeing old bugs on this supposedly fixed take a look here for more info. [URL]
without removing packages that depend on it
that would break package management (bad), so no. Only way you can do it is create a dummy package
ugg, my lirc didnt get setup right cause i didnt it through chroot on my appleTV, and i dont want to uninstall all this other crap lol
I'm not familiar with that specifically, but could reconfiguring it help?
oh really?. doesn't WOL solve that?
for all intents and purposes the computer is off.  WOL is something else and it can wake computers up from hibernate or suspend, if your bios supports it
whoops, i don't know why the hell i typed that, i meant to say ubuntu. windows boots fine
What problem occurs when you try to boot into Ubuntu (regularly, not recovery)
log into ssh address
ssh -l username address. type that in Terminal
it's not there..
IS there not a folder in there for "media"?
I found it.. ~/Videos... hauahuaha
Ah. Smarter than you thought ti was!
what is "hpet increasing min_delta_ns to 22500 nsec" ?
Is it a desktop PC?

Could be an issue with acpi
It's been running ubuntu fine for over a year.. If it restarts again, I'll be back...
if  comes back tell him to do: dmesg | grep acpi | pastebin
yes I mean't keep programs running, however now it went back to normal. Quite odd
must be an open driver / slightly wonky system. you can try toggling between TTY1 and back again sometimes
I think I do have a driver issue. Laptop is a Lenovo ideapad Z560 Vmware player says I have no 3d support
well vmware player has nothing to do with the host OS operating
no Vmplayer was saing my host has no 3d support
right but that doesn't have any relevance to the host graphics going odd. or are you saying it was a guest.... Descriptioned: IRC as root? :)
No it was graphics on my laptop but when I launch a guest OS of windows 10 vmware says hardware acceleration is not available because of my linux driver.
and which driver are you using?. assuming you're after help with that and not just tangenting :). yeah oops alright :)
Whatever driver Ubuntu 14.04 installed when I installed it. The Vmware is just a tangent
oh ok so you're not asking for help on it? nevermind then
No I'm not asking for help on the Vmware issue. I am asking for help on the Ubuntu hoist os issue. I think the graphics problem are related to the driver on the host os
alright so identify what graphics hardware you have first, by pastebin'ing "lspci" .. you can't say you think that when i already said i think that :P
[URL]
and "cat /proc/cpuinfo" ?
was there any in these past few days? because a dkms module randomly broke and won't compile anymore and thats the only reason i can think of
for me the 96 kernel was installed on 9/18
So... if I just have a pentium-dual core and just use it for regular use, no need...?
Will that even support 64-bit?
yes i know to do that, just, it fails cause /boot is 100%. so i have to manually remove stuff, then do cleanup
I'd suggest your problem is one of the commonest mentioned on this channel
just didn't know if there is something that should be happening automatically to automatically discard the old kernels. perhaps there should be a package made that runs and keeps it clean, idunno. :). i got it sorted out, just didn't know if it was supposed to do that, sounds like it is whate everyone else experiences too
no. Ubuntu doesn't create a separate /boot by default. If you go against the defaults, it should be your responsibility
hmm, these are default installs. server installs. didn't create separate things at all
really???
just followed the wizard. really.. pop in the cd, follow the wizard, end up with a server with /boot
what size?
Check System->Pref->Sound->Hardware and change profile.. Should be Digital Stereo and Analog Stereo
there are only Analog profile..
where?. I open nautilus
yes. right click a folder. go to properties or whatever
kinda its hotsed on ubuntu
if it's an ubuntu issue we can help
i have domain and i dont know why apache cannot see it its [URL], how can i see where is the problem?. im hosting on apache
does the hostname [URL] respond if you query it from the apache server in question
i get the page cannot be displayed
that's not what I asked.  from the apache server, can you resolve the full DNS name in question
how i do that?
have you ever hosted a website before ?
yeah. i ask with what tool i use
ok, so check the dns name resolves on the apache machine
done, didn't work.
!webcam.  its possible its not supported then
camorama send an error "Could not connect to video device /dev/video0"
when a supported cam is plugged in. it normally loads the proper modules and makes that /dev/video0 device. You could chekc 'dmesg' output and near the end it may mention some info about that camera.  i would say check the !webcam factoid and the forums. thats basically the extent of my webcam trouble shooting. In the past either they worked from teh start.. or were totally unsupported.
ahh, just hit a problem, my vista disk is 64bit. it failed to load 64bit system :(.  yeh, this is a dual core.
is your system 32bit?
no, it's core2 duo, 64bit. nope,, def 64bit -4 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Tue Nov 4 19:33:06 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
hmm, sec
cool, thanks for this help :)
what version of virtualbox do you have (dpkg -l | grep virtualbox)
2.0.4
hmm apparently it does 64bit guests
do i need to enable any ofthe switches in settings? apic extensions? vt-x eetc.  tried with both vt on and off.. but maybe i didn't enable my vt support at all in my machine's bios..?
at what point does it die? is it an official MS disk?
bad syntax? kill -9. kill pid isn't working,
- did you try that and it gave you and error?
yes i tried it ,and i told you it gave an error.
- wierd. are you using bash
beelive so, default
- try killall mplayer
Would you care to tell me how? :)
system>pref>keyboard shortcuts.  did you get to the editing screen?
How do you create a new one? I've attempted that, and seen previously configured keyboard shortcuts that I can edit... But nothing such as "Add this action to the list" "Associate complex keystroke with action"... That sort of thing..  Yes, I have it up.
ah, sorry. I misunderstood your question. I don't know how to assemble your own shortcuts :(
Heh. You're straight... Eh... Is it possible, though?. Stcom: Or would you know a specific place to ask such a question?
I would think that maybe here, or the ubuntu forums would probably work.  maybe someone else in here, or the ubuntu website forums

youre welcome
and, what about Moblin? it works just with Atom?
... I haven't tried moblin on non-Atom machines yes. But my guess is it should also work.
iris noone is dere to chat
what problem are you facing?
i can install from the disk
O.o error message?
Why do I need a program to do that? Can't I do it from Sessions?
Your window manager Metacity is only a minimalistic program. It has not enough functionality.
I looked at devilspie, looks to complicated for me.
I hope that you have the opportunity to visit a local computer club and get help there.
Huh?
I do not understand your question "Huh?". Please use Standard English.. '~$ sudo ethtool eth0: Settings for eth0: Supported ports: [TP MII].' What does mean 'TP' and 'MII'?
!!. finally. thanks kushai
you're welcome
thanks
you're welcome!.  for help go to #debian :). They can answer your detailed questions.
thanks!
No problem :)
ohh
this isn't windows. You don't need antivirus in linux.
sorry!
Could you rephrase your question? It's not clear.
i am trying to print in colors using linux on my toshiba printer
have you installed CUPS?.  install CUPS, then install a driver for your printer (you will need to search for your printer model, most probably), then try to print in color
yea i have cups installed, the printer works fine in black n white. in color tab i see no profile found
google <your printer model> color driver ubuntu
yes. http://
So, it's just wget http://localhost:4001/ ?
Ok, ok.
what do you want to install?.  [URL]
sounds good to me, thx
i've had a recommendation when building a RAID array to use disks from 2 manufacturers from different batches , so if theres a bad batch .... so anyone know why I don't have a /dev/mapper and cant access my LVM partitions ?
(800fps glxgears yay). yes. in linux
i've gotta get that setup... i got ut2004 and doom3 running
what vidcard?. i got geforce 2 go
ATI Radeon 9800 PRO
do you see: Connected to 8.8.8.8.. after you telnet?
yeah. it says connected
ok, so TCP works
and i can ping 8.8.8.8. but doing dig @8.8.8.8 hostname doesn't work
10.04, is there a ppa with the latest nvidia driver? version 260 according to the nvidia website
[URL]
what driver are you using?
I'm actually not even sure, it just worked. I'll check - just a sec.
ahh, so you haven't attempted to use kismet or anything like that?
No, I've just used network-admin and netapplet.
ok, i guess it doesn't really apply to me then. but you haven't noticed that after a few reboots you need to reinstall ubuntu to get the card to recognize again?
Nope. I doesn't scan, though. That's pretty annoying.
nvidia 440 go
- someone gave me this nice xinerama link earlier: [URL]
let me try...
I'm not sure it is the solution. Just an idea.
rings a bell a bit...
yeah. Same for me
thats what caused this scenario. If I unplug it, it calms down but then I can't configure it.
that doesn't cause it -- make sure it is not set to auto but manual
but I want to access it from another account.
: you mean as in remote or from the same computer?
same.  without swtiching user
: logoff and do it?
thx
that's single user mode....  if you want to just not start GDM turn off the script
text mode rite?.  eh? they change the way!!.  can u tell me which startup config file so I can turn off GDM?
go to TTY([CTRL] +[ALT] +[F1] ) and type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop.  this will end your X session and just give you a command prompt
okay. thx. thx. ur legend\
to restart sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
ATI Radeon X600
ok then run: sudo lshw -C display to see the driver you are using, see if there are any bugs reported for your release, for that chip using the driver you are using.  is it a laptop or a desktop?
it doesn't do anything
also, make sure it is actually running in the background as a service/process. do synapse& in a terminal..
it opens when i synapse in the terminal
do synapse& , with the & at the end..  then do ctrl+space...  to bring it up, as and when needed.
bios as in at the boot screen you press F12 or something like that?
yeah, well it might or might not be F12, every motherboard has a different key, but it usually says "Press <somekey> to enter SETUP".  I also recommend you look for overclocking tutorials on google
thanks a lot. I found how to use post-up in google. but which man page do you refer to? I tried "man ifup" and "man /etc/network/interfaces". both does not have post-up description.
"man interfaces"
got it. thanks. one more question, should I create a script by root user or normal user? which user will execute that command? I guess it's root, right?
Root, yeah.
I did. When I installed my drivers after a fresh install of 10.10 my term began to be transparent. I went to Edit->Profile Preferences->Background to set my image. When I do that, the term stays transparent and I see through the image. If I turn up the transparency to 100%, the background color from Colors tab, will cover the background image
I wonder if you have compiz or visual effects that are causing the transparency. Are your other windows transparent?
i have compiz but this issue started before I installed that. I installed compiz to try and turn it off.  I was looking in there for a way to add an exception to transparency
If it's a compiz issue, you can add exceptions but it depends on which compiz feature you are using. In "Opacity" there is a Window specific setting where you can add rules.
its not an default installation.  in an default ubuntu installation i have an gdm as login manager and i will do it without an login manager
all you have to do in a default install is to go into system menu / administration / security tab and check the box for automatic login and select a user there.
but that uses the gdm.  and it starts the gdm, but gdm need to much RAM
yes, but the user won't see it, it will go straight in and log the user in.
its not about what the user will see ;). its about my memory
ahhh, ok, well, I'm not sure how else to do it. You may be able to find a lighter weight login manager.
what do you mean  ?
You didn't say what protocol you're talking about. I assume it's ssh?
yes ssh. i did changed the .ssh/known_hosts (i delted it, and it asked me to add the new one, i said yes), but now it says permission denied (publickey). what am i doing wrong
you changed something with the public key files on either the client or the ~/ of the user you're sshing to.
ok how do i fix it now
depends, what did you change?
i made a new ec2 instance of ubuntu server... i think it made a new rsa host key. nothing is changed on the computer who wants to connect to ec2
allow password-based connections, then ssh-copy-id user@hostname on the client.
i am not sure, really.  oh yes.. i have pssword login disabled on sshd
although I don't do EC2, so that may or may not work for you.
when you say do ssh-copy-id user@host on the client, which pc do i run that from? ec2 or the comptuer who wants to connect to ec2
the user who wants to connect to ec2
did ya add yourself to sudo group again?
yup.  its still asking for a password though... proper sudoers is 'user ALL=NOPASSWD:/cmd' no?
silly question, but what's the last line of sudoers.  if it's (ALL) ALL, that overrides everything set in the file.  yeah, that's the right syntax
give me a sec ill check
yeah, so I've noticed... we really could use one..
just type !op. !op
online ? on Ubuntu website?
yes: the address is listed in the topic: under FAQ (frequently asked questions): it has loads of useful information

I am trying to install stuff via dpkg
please give me the exact command you are using
sudo apt-get install lzma
can you pastebin the output of the error please.
Where can i find the gnomee art package. ? in programsinstall or is that an internet download or something else?
universe repo

thanks!
thank you for your answer. will those commands free the memory taken by the processes?
assuming the process ended, you should reclaim mem
I used sigkill and it seems that the memory is not as free as it should be. how can i reset it? will a reboot work?
a reboot will definitely clean up
i tried it but it doesnt work
Also, VNC isn't very secure on it's own, I recommend tunneling it over an ssh session(and recommend pubkey authentication for ssh).  Does it give you any error messages?
even ssh doesnt work. connection timed out
Are you connecting across a lan or over the internet?
over the internet
Did you forward the ports in the router?
i use a 3g modem
Can you get on the same lan and the server your trying to connect to and then connect?

ps -x works fien on its own. hm, doing just "ps x | blah" works fine
alias x='ps -x'.  copy and paste that
i guess it just doesnt like the -, as Pumpkin- said.  ah that works fine now. why does ps not use - for its arguments
it does.  hence why you can do ps -x
but why did x=`ps -x` not work
because you are using back ticks
but x=`ls -l` works
it's to do with how it executes it, I've seen this before with another command an alias
will that alias command now last forever/. ?
no, if you exit the shell it will go
is there a permanent solution?
but it in your bashrc
ah ok, just exactly the same as how you posted it?
yup
ok thanks.  is there a way to add that rule for all arguments?
that rule for all arguments ?. what do you mean ?
i want to also be able to do x=`ps -eax`. or x=`ps -aux`. or whatever
stop using back ticks.  if you type "alias" you'll see all the aliases use ' not `
' is a quotation mark
no, it's a single quote
if i do x='ps -eax' it will just echo the text 'ps -eax'
no it won't.  as you've just seen
i just did x='ps -eax' then echo $x and i get ps -eax as the echoed response. as in those letters. backticks have always been the way i assign commands to variables
you don't echo a command.  that is setting a variable, not a alias.  you said you wanted to do an alias. alias x='ps -ef' is an alias x='ps -ef' is a variable
oh. so is there a way to do alias x='ps -allArgs'. or something similar
what you are saying makes no sense.  you can alias what ever you want
but i dont want to have to alias every single argument of ps
alias x='whatever you want".  sorry you are making no sense.  you want to alias x='ps -allargs" but you don't want to type ps -allargs
so i can select between agp and pci?
effectively, yes. use lspci to find out the bus ID for each device
btw, how do determine BusID from lspci or dmesg?
lspci, yes
yes
can you use the function key display output toggle instead?
doesn't seem to do anything
oh, that's not great
know one that plays FM channels? or do those also?
many radiostations provide stream, or do you speak of a receicer-card
no reciever card. DaSEi: receicer*
receiver, y, many s stations stream via urls
I like foxytunes stations but it's a plugin for browser.. Ya I want a seperate program.
as said, streamtuner, amarok, audacious, many players can read stream.  or even winamp , if you're after the urls just
ya i was hoping i'd find a certain HD2 radio station that's on Foxytunes(Yahoo messenger plugin). No luck.
no homepage with a link provided ?
which do you think i should try first?
VirtualBox is floss and you can get it right now. VMware is commercial, but it has an excellent video driver passthrough.
so its possible to develop a game using both openjdk and oricals java for windows using jmonkey3?. Thats one less heartattack i need :D
the code you write has nothing to do with the jvm it runs on.  if it does, that's a bug in one of the jvms by definition. erm,  ^
ok, thanks I assume its just the compiling phazes would be the difference lol
no.  no differences in the byte code either
how do i do that?
gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst add that right where you find quiet and splash in your boot-command line right before the "--"
i want to disable SSH and VNC and all remote desktop things
ssh-agent manages keys.  sshd is the deamon
you mean like apt-get update?
2.0.29 is the stable version suggested for most users,
well there is no newer version of gpg offered
[URL]
Ok I see. But my collegue has the exact same ubuntu/thunderbird/enigmail installation you know, and he has no issues with that
from the other side you can always downgrade ur enigmail, i suppose it was updated thats why it doesnt work with ur old Enigmail
ok so maybe enigmail was updated. I have to check that
are you 100% sure that ur collegue has exactly same versions?
bot about enigmail, I'm curerntly checking that. I was to fast with stating that, sorry
im not using GnuPG but i think its better to use more currenty recommended version than old one
I guess that this makes definitely sense. I mean it is a huge version jump
well im not sure of that.  check last post here.  [URL]
hehe ok
on my ubuntu gnupug 1.4.18-7. gnupg*
also wondering why enigmail probably has just updated itself. without my consent. maybe I got hacked. :P
i dont know, tbh im linux user for few days so far ;p
oh ok i should've went there
they might be asleep right now, but i'll help as soon as i can if they are
ok then im getting a serious error
what error
yes
The Linux kernel has experimental support for DisplayPort 1.0, and DisplayPort provide a Linux driver for later versions, but be warned it replaces the system libusb
is server edition ok?.  no desktop
that should be sufficient - install will probably be slow, depending on the methods you're using to install. (and what you selected at tasksel)
nope, nothing like that
you have to have it running for some time though
no im saying i check for sys usage all the time
ok. do you have compiz enabled
nope. not even using proprietary drivers
Done a memory test? Could be hardware-related also
Jorn this comp is on (use it as a router) 24/7 i dont have time to use memtest
But I guess rebooting 10 times a day is not something you have time for either? ;)
thanks for the hcl. The thing with first finding a printer and then checking compatibility is that it takes so much time. I would rather find a list of compatible hardware (like hcl) and then choose one from there which I fancy..  but the HPLIP tip was a good one. the HP ColosLaserjet CP1515n seems to be a good one. Fully compatible with HPLIP
hp rock that way :)

i will, but i have to go now
ok, later. clean/fix the download?
its not about converting but its about the input/output error =)
for bash to call command-not-found you must be calling a program that is not installed
it can't access the whole disk, as its giving me this message for EVERY command. like ls. df
so why didn't you state that earlier instead of confusing us with " I work in my shell, convert a qemu image and bam, /usr/bin/command-not-found: Input/Output Error". :-D.  did you try checking the file system?
is there a way to check my xfs root filesystem or will I need an external system?
not sure, but I think you can just run fsck on it without unmounting it (fsck needs the filesystem mounted anyway)
I will check that. thanks for helping anyway.
try "man fsck" if that works. and run it on your filesystem. or do all commands fail because they can not be found or because those commands like "ls" df access the whole disk or something.
would it be necessary to throw away all the installed 32bit apps ?
no. all 32bit aps run on 64bit
Which all would be the necessary components ? - GCC / Kernel / glibc ?.  Which all would be the necessary components ? - 64bit GCC / 64bit Kernel / 64bit glibc ?
of course that would depend on the progs you want to run
they complain about buzzwords, but as soon as something has 5 features it's sophisticated, even if it takes 5 hours to configure

"pydoc flask" should do it.  You can also run "pydoc -g" and search for documentation using a graphical interface.. Note that python-tk has to be installed.
i tried lsusb and what you said :[URL]
it looks like linux doesn't like your phone.  what are you trying to do?.  can you paste the dmesg|tail -n 50 also?
xmodmap's man.  is for mapping keys and buttons, and i want to have this done at startup, and they say to put a line in "the user's session startup script".
probably ~/.xmodmaprc
i wish i had one of those!
startup files are usually in the user's home directory with a . in front of the file and rc after, like .bashrc for the bash shell
thanks
can=cant sorry
thanks :). jas have u tried xscreensaver?. oops wrong window.  There is a screensaver "Euphoria" that comes on the regular screen saver thing from ubuntu, but xscreensaver doesnt show it :(
yea, been looking for that myself i think its part of gnome-screensaver
hmm.  cuz i have it already, ive used it, but its not on xscreensaver, so I have to transfer it somehow? or what :S
i wouldn't know, never tried it
As in, putting in a new PHYSICAL drive
well what hardware? and did u try installing AGAIN?.  it was only stage 1 of the installation anyways
gnome
kmix works for KDE, prolly for Gnome too >.>
I'm trying to replace gnome-terminal
all at once.
where can I learn about the packages that are in its repositories

I'm trying to install onto an iMac,. the live cd works,
Which iMac?
but the install doesn't,. a lime,. rev C maybe.
How does the install fail?
The X windows system cannot start,
Yeah, I have a grape here. Can you log in on the console and check /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
not at the moment,. but what should I look for there?
Well, when you can, do so and check the bottom of that file for the error that causes it to fail.
I see.
it's normally something straightforward (like a wrong mouse device)
seeing as WinAmp doesn't work, I'm at lost at what to do. yeah, I tried Amarok
xmms is great for just mp3
i will try that. I am going to assume yes is the answer
In both cases even the startup disk did not show any video
i am helping some lady too
:D.  boot from the CD to make sure the machine itself is ok
well lets assume there is no hardware problems
yeah, it's not worth replacing the motherboard on an older laptop IMO
nope, still uses 37% on many site. could it be a flash problem?
we're talking sustained 37% cpu, not just when it loads the page?
sorry spock, when installing. its been there for about 25-40 min now
Oh, How long is it stuck for, I had to wait half an hour once while it sat at 93.  No idea, What distro is it?
ok spock, i just let it sit, ive got nothing better to do. its xubnutu 7.10
I havent installed that one, Only 7.04..
for shipIT to send my cd. :)
I couldn't wait. I downloaded and burned my own.
you are lucky bowtrik
Do they send you a CD in a neat, pretty package?
not really. just a paper case
Ah
While clicking on it from nautilus
clicking on what? the windows partition?
Yes
ok. You probably just need to mount it. Should be able to right-click and Nautilus and select "Mount". in Nautilus**
already installed
and the apache perl module?
how would i do that? ><
make a script someplace with the command: sleep 10; conky & after the usual bash header line: #!/bin/bash then add it to your startup items and remove the current conky startup item
So if I have luck I may install it by looking for the source?
there might be dependency problems that prevented it from being included, for example
Mh, seems this thing is quite old: "Parts of page may be obsolete. See sam2p on Google Code instead. " and 404 on Google code ...
so probably not included because it is deprecated/unmaintained. you'd better look for a replacement.
this was a dependency for an other software. So I will tell them they should switch to something else, or pack it inside.
sounds like the best option.
Thanks for the help ;)

I'm looking for a way to keep them accessible, so that I don't have to roll them into tars or something like that
jumber encrypting them will make so only your acount on your computer can decrypt and read them it doesnt compress them.  encrypting them will make so only your acount on your computer can decrypt and read them it doesnt compress them
How would I do so?
rightclick said files>Encrypt
I just TABbed the name, so it got automagically escaped
it should have, yes
why not gedit
you asked about a terminal command
i hear you spreading fud about gentoo a few times a day, among all your other useless rambling. could you try sticking to the topic?
why do you call it FUD....these are simple facts and we should be allowed to compare things with ubuntu in a ubuntu channel.
8 months?. this is not a fact, that is crap
yes  i have been installing gentoo for 8 months and it still is not finished.
then you are doing something wrong.
and he said he installed ubuntu in 20 minutes.
me too. i can install gentoo in ~1 hour
well i don't know what i am doing wrong..i am just trying to keep up with the witch doctor over there.
ok so when grub boots up I hit e. then what do I edit?
as to what you need, i don't know. in my experience, removing parameters usually helps :P
hah ok I can give that a try
e edits whichever line you have selected. anyone know why > fails to work in clipman custom actions?. i think it fails in thunar too
that'll fix firefox, but what about when i'm apt-getting and it's being slow..
does ifconfig show an ipv6 interface?
i have an inet6 addr, is that it?
remove the 'auto XXX' for it in /etc/network/interfaces
auto eth0? that's my wired connection. what will it do?. i've just used a tutorial to disable ipv6
link?
[URL]
ok, leave eth0 alone
Yes I did, i finally just closed it and reopened it
makes sense, not used it myself. I just use apt-get :)
that doesn't make it permenant
obviously with the correctly spelled words where they should be.
?
when you figure it out let me know cause the above is all I know.
ok. I mean it works, but it's not permanent. When I close out gtkpod or w/e and click on the iPod it goes back to rhythym box.
.bz2 is an archive. open it with nautilus or archive manager.
dude. thats not it
read the ubuntu guide,
It will probably run, it's a quite old game.. and not really demanding.
thanx.  BloodSong I spent all night yesterday trying to download and launch tor and steam and failed... the processes that ran in terminal after putting in accurate commands were not the same as what it's supposed to show on youtube tutorials - I suspect there's an issue with my recent upgrade to 17.10
flannel why i can not see the last word in the x chat
... I have no idea? I don't use XChat. last word of what? the topic? peoples chatter?
flannel so i can not understand what you say. flannel which software are you using to chat
irssi. but, that's not important. I don't know why your last word is clipped off.
I've heard you don't have to if your using the ext4 filesystem
Is that the default?
did you do a full install?
On my school computer we first did something called LFS then we installed Ubuntu. Part of my class.. I need to install Ubuntu here at home though.
I would suggest the USB install make sure you do a full install. If your going to do a dual boot is a good idea to make your partitions with windows before you install
you know what. I think I am going to do that right now. I can put all my docs and stuff in the cloud.. I'll be back in a while with a clean install of Ubuntu :)

yes
yes, it won't work. lol
ah, thanks.  *tries to sudo apt-get Xming* oh yea, windows
xming is soo handy. I have my linux machines X apps showing up on the Windows desktop. :) or ya can do it fullscreen. or run a whole desktop.  yea.. ya sort of need a X server on windows to display the apps :)

pretty fast here
exactly my problem :|
does /usr/lib/python2.6/optparse.py exist?
yes
in a python shell, import sys, "/usr/lib/python2.6" in [URL]th should return true
i found the problem
although, if it is not, then you have bigger problems, and python likely wouldn't work correctly.  what was the problem?
I
???
in Unity ?
was only an idea
strg= what key is that?
Ctrl. sry (i am german)
no, it does not show any options on Unity Bar
ok, then i have no idea
so would the public key of the browser be a good fingerprint for a machine ?
dont quote me on that, but yea i belive its asymetric and requires both the public and private (browser) key..  so i wouldn't think it would be efficient to generate a new key pair for every request
so then it can be used as a finerprint
im not sure about that
I believe I have another solution anyways
glad to hear it
should i used 32 bits or amd 64 to install it in vmware that runs on ms windows 7?
either are fine, 64 is better for virtualization
no, i can't. it seems like it does it, but when i reboot it doesn't has any partition
did you try fdisk /dev/sdX then type "o" ?
Nope, it just boots to a blinking underscore symbol. :-/
are you sure the problem is grub?
I am not SURE it is with grub.. but it only happened after I expanded my main parition after deleting an old one.. so I assume it has something to do with the bootloader..
also, tried deactivating the floppy drive and unplugging USB devices?.  but can you see the grub menu?
nope
can you paste files to pastebin?
Sure.....  What do you want?.  Actually, there does happen to be an error when I go to update grub.. let me try to replicate it quick.
I need the output from the 'lsblk' or 'fdisk -l' commands, and I need the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file
Okay.. here's where I get the error: [URL]
[URL]  try adding --force to grub-install
install a bad driver. I fixed it though. I uninstalled it completely now what?
can you install the correct driver? ;)
I still have the problem. kareese, I don't see it in hardware drivers and considering I screwed up last time I dont think its a good idea I try again.....
while it might suck - try googling your wireless card (find it with "lshw -C network").  special instructions, probably
I've already done mine.
ok
vulkan it doesent work
it must have a different package name. i'll check synaptic
ubuntu server edition
oh, sorry :)
not your fault, i didn't specify
give me a sec, my network conf does not use nw...
ok
auto eth0. iface eth0 inet dhcp
<unconvertable> explain my problem on the link.
you propably is not in the correct folder when you try and run the file. or is it installed in ROOT/APPS/TEAMVIEWER.....  also teamviewer is in the repro's, why are you manually installing?
i want to open on every machine. thats why it is portable. my friend does not allow me to install it on his machine.
also teamviewer has a *.deb package on their website, if you NEED 8.
what you mean with: "or is it installed in ROOT/APPS/TEAMVIEWER....". this is a portable version.
so you want a poratble version like the windows version?.  the paths in the link you gave are root locations aka not based in your home folder
<unconvertable> should put it on my /home/username/ folder? why? <unconvertable> get all permissions of /apps already.
it is just strange to need to put it there, then own the directory, when you can simply run it from your home folder with no permission issues.. Tell me slowly again what you want to do
here the latest version of my explanation: [URL]
did you make all files execute able? Are you using the .tar.gz file or a .deb package?
Attansic ethernet and Atheros AR9285 Wireless. I'm told the latter can be done with a kernel upgrade. 1008HA. ^
ahh yes that required a kernel module to be compiled, helped somebody through that before
i'm fine with a little kernel hacking but it's the attansic i'm worried about, i don't see that anywhere
the what?
the ethernet card. as in the hard line version
oh that, hold on i have a guide up for the 1008ha
because getting kernel sources etc. would be a PitA without internet of any form
do you have a usb drive handy?
somewhere...
well you are going to need it ;)
got an idea for the ethernet card?
yes there is a driver available
oh goodie, .deb maybe?
of course not, that would make things too easy
true, can't have that happening...
if you have another computer with the same exact kernel version, you can use that to compile the driver
unfortunately pretty much all my computers are amd64 at this point...
ouch, seriously? nothing?
I don't have write right on it.  I cannot reproduce it in /tmp
because /tmp has the sticky bit set, which then makes ownership of the files count.
does that pkg version actually mean 0.10.. or 10.0.. ?
0.10
on centos, when I install, it says nodejs-6.10.3-1.el7.x86_64. this pkg gives the binary for dev server also. is 0.10.25 far away from 6.10.3 ?
Ubuntu 14.04 will have whatever was the latest stable version when 14.04 went into package freeze. Sometime in early 2014
I'm confused between version numbers for concern about compatibility. but 14.04 is still getting update(s) ? so, it'd have some updated version now ?
only security updates and bug fixes, it won't get any upgraded version
is 0.10.25 far away from 6.10.3 or somewhere close ?
node.js used a different versioning scheme before the io.js split
ah, their room is invite only. how far is it in version ?
0.12.x was the last version before the split, and when they merged back together, they started on 4.0.x, using semver.  Hm? #node.js is not invite only.  anyway, again, The node.js version in Ubuntu 14.04 is what was the stable node.js version in early 2014
how about npm
same, whichever npm version was stable at the same time
Node.js 0.10.3 2013-04-03 3.14.5.8 1.2.17 0x000B. 2013! ?. Is there a way to get a more later version on 14.04.3 ?. to get around 6.10.3 version, which supports 3.x npm
you can always grab a precompiled tarball of nodejs 6.x, extract that somewhere, and specifically use that for the application in question
I could ?. there's prebuilt ones ?
[URL]
Thanks..  How do I find out the package name?
what app?
Videos.  Videos
not sure what the default vid player is :(
no
try running sudo nvidia-settings and use it to identify your monitor
not doing anything..
use the view menu
nothing in there
sidebar
I know, but there's no entry there!
what about edit-prefs-behavior-always open in broser windows
how do i make it work in python 3 also?. all my packages go to 2.7
if that .py script is not written for 3.2, it will fallback to 2.7, there are slight diff between the two languages
yes i know but i downloaded the latest version for python 3.2
you can force to run a scriupt like this >> " python2.7 /path/to/script" or "python3.2 /path/to/script"
and where do i force this run?
see this answer #4 > [URL] or join #python
i want to use the command "write" to talk to the other user in ubuntu. but ,wirte is turned off. how to turn on it?. do you know how to make it?
oh that
from a usb disk.  from a usb stick *. i created usb stick using usb-creator from other ubuntu laptop
ok, did you do an md5sum check on it?
no. but i had the same issue with other version of ubuntu too
yeah you probably need to re-doanload the iso?
True..  You can even make it look like 10.10.
How?
like /home/user/.emacs?
yes
is the "Y-my-ppa" (or smth like) software a good way to do so ,. ?
Not even sure what that is.  You can use ppa-purge to remove PPAs and simply use apt-get to remove software
and by the way thanks for the advice yesterday, dd worked just fine. t
Oh, good to hear
I know but how do I check which software comes from ppa and so on ?
I'm not too sure of that.
does gedit sense c++ ?
it has plugins to do code high light
python console?
? ipython
yeah. nothing happens, it's like the grub/bootloader/whatever it's called is just tellng me what im telling it to do instead of doing it
Grab the alternate CD instead if you can. It'll install without having to go through the live environment
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G92 [GeForce GTS 250] (rev a2)
Okies.
i think that's what I needed. thanks
You're welcome.
oh... and how do I work out the version?
Is there something you want to do when you find out the version of the card?
I'm trying to get help with getting FL MP working in wine. Someone in #winehq is asking about my graphics card drivers version
I believe you have all the info you need. [GeForce GTS 250] is the exact card name.. (rev a2) is pretty much the verion number.
just rebooted with this as my fstab line. UUID=0cfc4f9c-9c18-474c-bf08-7f12a26c57a4 /mnt/MediaDrive ext4 defaults 0 0. and plex can access the mounted drive. but not see the contents inside. Windows sucks

you need to install the -dev package of glibc.  get it in synatpic
there are a few iwan but it does not give me a chance to selest multiples. no. from the intaller menu
what distro are you using
i can't write to the ipod, i get permission denied. don't know what else to try
that's a mounting problem, not gtkpod probelm
how do you view pics at 1:1
1:1 ? Don't understand
most viewer programs allow you to view the picture in actual pixels.  full size.  i can get f-spot to do that.  i can zoom in but it doesnt tell me at what percentage its showing me the pic in
good question, I never noticed that. That's something that should definitely be included
have you tried gphoto2?
hadn't heard of it until now.
do you shoot in raw or jpg
tiff, space permitting.  maybe this is old, but gphoto2 doesn't look that feature-full : [URL]
ya i didnt think so either but hadnt tried it yet.  f-spot is ok minus a few things
I agree, it could use some more features.  there's one other I tried, I forget ....
Thanks. I will check the manpage. Just on the off-chance, do you know how to get it to search sub-directories?
you'll want to use the -R flag to search recursively
yes sorry. When trying to move/paste files into the drives, they say they are "read-only". I am logged in on the only account on the system (except for going in as root) using GUI to cut/paste
i'd be willing to bet that the RAID setup is being mounted read only in /etc/fstab
The problem is that it needs a non-pae installer. Where to get the one for Lubuntu? I didn't find it.. *-installer +kernel

yeah, console
bash: run: command not found
just "emerald --replace"
No, sir. I know it, and auto-login isn't enabled..  I know this is stupid to ask but are you sure it is not actually runing the resolution?
running the resolution you want?
Yeah..  Would you like me to demonstrate what I mean?
if you're happy with the way it looks then there's no point in changing it.  yea
hehe

not that i can see
I wonder if network manager might be messing with it....  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart.  ?
- I think there's a problem with my repositories. Even copy-pasting exact file names from the wiki etc, I get package not found.. Example - E: Couldn't find package gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
ahhhhh... I know what you need to do
I'm glad :P
have you enabled universe/multiverse repositories?
- Yeah.
have you hit Reload?. or Refresh, I forget. I'm not on my Ubuntu machine right now
Reload/refresh where?

no audio on videos. works fine in Firefox
on a specific website or everywhere?
all video flash / html5. @ any ideas?
if you start a video in chrome and then open your sound prefs and select the Applications tab, do you see chrome listed in there?
@kostdon: hmmm let me check. @ no, it is not listed
hmm
@ it was working fine, did some auto updates and its stopped working. @ thinking it was an oss update
?!!?!.  have you by any chance installed oss or tried to configure your sound somehow?
nope. @ oss is installed but has been for a while
do you now the reason?.  why it was installed.  maybe it was a dep for something else, do you remember
think it was for using my usb condensor mic. i can uninstall and see if that works. @ checked in Synaptic... oss is not installed so must be an Alsa problem?
possibly
is it possible to revert to Alsa that was used before update?
do you remember what packages were updated?
no. i just said update all
how long ago. Maybe it's still in the dpkg.log
last week. should be, where is the log located?
in a terminal, give: gedit /var/log/dpkg.log
k, brb. @ only audio related update was Pulse Audio on the 18th. has to be the culprit
hmm right. in a terminal give: ps -A pulse do you get any output?
@ get a sytax err, should there be a | grep in there?
lol sorry, yeah, it should be ps -A | grep pulse
k. @ output // 2417 ? 00:29:00 pulseaudio
ok
@ is there a way to downgrade PulseAudio?
no need to, but you could reset it, by doing the following: pulseaudio -k then: rm -rf ~/.pulse and finally: pulseaudio -D
k
close all the apps that are capable of producing audio before doing it
@ what about system sounds?
not it's ok. actually the apps that are currently connected to pulseaudio, like e.g. if you are have a media player running or an flash vid in firefox
@ ok will let you know what happens. @ output// E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed.
ok then give again: rm ~/.pulse, then logout and login back again
So I'm trying to grab updates to a few large files from a remote server, and I *only* want to grab updates and get new files.  I wouldn't want my own local server to delete anything from the remote server
i was reading the manual last night, i think it has a flag for something like that
is it 32 bit ubuntu os supports to install in 64 bit processor
yes 64bit CPUs can emulate 32bitness
that's SMTP right?
right
maybe. panels are all working
you using regular gnome?
yep. i think i deleted some stuff on the desktop today.. but i didnt think that mattered
try running gnome & from a terminal.  the ampersand is important
gnome is already running though
ok... restart it.  do you have panels?.  those things at the top and bottom of your screen.  they're white by default
hrm its back now.... all that stuff was fine . just the desktop didnt appear. the actual jpg image, and none of the icons. panels and applications all ran fine @_@. anyway seems to be back to normal now so cheers :)
::nods:: gnome probably flaked out for some reason... did something the kernel didn't like... so it killed then restarted it... probably just took awhile to take effect
hehe
same thing happens in xfce when you kill xfdesktop

speed shows 54 Mb/s I guess its G....  how can i tell if my laptop can handle wireless n?
you can have some fun with iwconfig and iwspy and iwlist. look into those tools. you can also check the output of 'dmesg' - sometimes wireless negotiation information can be found there -- well, if you run 'lspci' you can find out what type of hardware it is, and google the hardware
None change.
can you pastebin ~/.Xresources for me?

ok, those look good. how do you test them - which terminal etc?

Yes, I have separate LVs for /var/ /var/cache/ /var/logs/ and /var/cache/apt/archives and some other
I assume by LV you mean LVM/BTRFS "logical volumes"?
Yes
I have an RTL8187 wireless "antenna" which plugs into the motherboard on the back. I can detect wireless networks, but it will not stay connected to my network
what driver are you using?
Whatever came was installed with ubuntu 7.10
odd...i have an rtl8187, i had to install a few thing to get it to go
Ok, so what did you have to do? Any help would be greatly appreciated :D
do an lsusb in terminal, and let me know what the number is next to Realtek Semiconductor (should be like 0bda:8187)
obda:8187. 0. Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0bda:8187 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
when you do an iwconfig, your wifi card comes up as...wlan0?
IEEE 802.11g
also, is it wpa/wep/or no encryption?
Yes, it shows a wireless card
as wlan0?
yes
ok you're using the kernel mode driver

I don't really know much about configuing grub you may want to ask the poeple in #grub
I've worked hard to try to figure out by myself.... but the real problem is I don't understand why the system hangs after the addition of the swap file but it dosen't when I boot in recovery mode :O
I'm not sure. How fair does it get when it hangs?
I think I would have to shoot a video...
Yeah that might be a pain.
it is exactly after we see ''Adding 8388604K swap on /dev/sda1. Priority:-1 extents:1 accross:8388604K''. during the boot process
I take sda1 is the root?
nop its the swap partition
Oh that might be you're problem
yes....  I read it, but still cant figure out why I cant upload files.  I'm using he virtual user configuration
any hints in the logs? (/var/log/)
ok, so move it there?
does it simply move or does it have associated files?
it's actually just a stupid problem. I've been working with HTML and whatnot but it's to do with images
Out with it, already :P
It's creating an image that will let the background show through it. like transparency. I thought it would be simple enough, but i cant fiure it out
You using CSS?
I've tried GIMP, photoshop, fireworks..
<img src="[URL]g" style="opacity: 0.8" />. 1 is fully opaque, 0 is invisible.
- yep, i press enter too fast
Lol :P
I did a rmmod and modprobe but my pc hangs after tht
do you have another pc available?
the problem is lunix loads the Tulip drivers.... yes.
can you hit alt + F<something> to drop to command line and read dmesg.  if you are running sshd and have another nic up, you could connect via ssh (assuming its not hung it wel enough) and read dmesg | tail
yes..it shows the card as detected.. this is wht I get when I do lspci: nel modules: de2104x
can you restart x with the nic still drivered up and stuff?
well I searched and I found tht this driver does not work for this chipset.
thats probably why you are getting the hangs
it's quite long, can i copy/paste it to you in a pm?
better is putting it on http://paste.ubuntu-[URL] , if I don't recognize the error someone else might
http://paste.ubuntu-[URL] i notice it still says Xgl is not present...i coulda swore i just installed it
what video card are you using?
I don't see one for the desktop, but I do see one for EC2 AMIs. Currently unowned.
comment on it and ask?
kthx.
alright
no in firefox
when replying to someone, its best to use their nick in your response, so they can see your reply
sure
what do you want to do ?
nope its desktop trusty
okay, i'm not familiar with Unity, but I am guessing it has a kind of control panel for startup applications. i use MATE myself. you can just add things in there
what do you mean what do you do ?
It is now 13 hours and it needs about more 16 hours.
then wait
My laptop is kind of hanging. And I need to do something
yeh
you can mount an iso or whatever with the mount command
"sudo mount". ?
mount -o loop [URL]o /mnt/
Sorry. It didn't work.
Did you try it with -s 256?.  And what is it showing when you try the command?
ifconfig -a
HWAddr?. on wlan0?
wlan0. wlan0 is the name
Error: 'dev wifi' command 'hotspot' is not valid.
your wifi is not up
how to set it up?
then why is it in the official iso?
Just a remnant.
yeah, I was, just restarted
so what did you type? if you're in terminal just typing nano should work?
the error above was what I got
well that doesn't make sense,
yes i can. everything is at 100%
ok in sound manager can u test the sound succesfully?
....what are you talking about?
if you go to Preferences->Sound and press test do you get sound?. yes
my php stopped working a simple <?php phpinfo(); ?> does not work
When was it working, when did it stop?.  What happened right before it stopped?
was working just fine, i think i installed screen and another program around the time it stopped working
Could be important what the other program was...
rtorrent, dont think it has anything to do with LAMP
Okay, try just re-installing the package you mentioned..  Er, I should say, try installing it.
ntfsresize
duh, sorry you already said that
ntfsresize -50G (what fdisk reports) /dev/sda1
i'm half brain dead today
won't even work with -f
that's strange...hmmm
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found
@ what Ubuntu release are you running?
ah, right, it does have it..  I mean /usr/lib.  still no lzma.  is it in multi-verse or whatever it is that Ubuntu calls it?. ,liblzma2
@ sorry of you already said this, but what release of Ubuntu are you running?
Precise
liblzma2 is no longer provided in Precise :-(
heh
else depend on apt-get
Ni, I'll.. *No.  Platinum rating in Wine HQ.
interesting
And no bugs related to my problem.
hmm :/
I use UFW firewall. But if that was a problem Spotify wouldn't start at all?
I don't know
start playing at alla, I mean-.  Ok.
you can have a separate partition on he same drive; I do that
i did that already, and i don't see how my gfx drivers can be relevant to this matter?. unless i am missing something
could try adjusting the font if everything else is fine
that took sometime didnt it? :) everything working ok?
lol, well i left it going while it compiled and attended to some much needed studying...but so far everything is working perfect
not sure, both guides give different drivers
-> which one did you use though?
one says use ath5k and the other is something like ath_pci
-> so you tried both? which dir did you install it at?
i think if you use 'linux-headers-686' that's a meta-package, and will update for you when the next kernel comes out and so forth. so you don't have to manually get the latest exact kernel header version each time
yes I just did that too. thanks!
amd 64 18ghz 1.5 gig ram and plenty of free hard drive space
hmmm maybe you have an irq conflict although it is very rare. nowdays. what wifi chipset?
dunno,how do i find out?
bodsa are you using a laptop or what? do you know if your wifi is on board or pci?
its a usb dongle on a desktop
oh then you should be able to look at the usb dongle and tell me what manufacturer and model
Belkin F5D7050B
bodsda [URL] [URL] two links
cheers dude.  the forum link was about mouse and keyboards and i made that bug report
hahaha i thought you might have. are you using ndiswrapper?
no im not, i dont know how and cant find propriety drivers for it
at least you know your bug report is out there hahaha. try using ndiswrapper and see if it improves anything..... i can give you a link to drivers one sec
where do i find th ekey?. froto doesnt have it
hmm, good question... that shouldn't happen. can you live without backports for a bit?
i thought it was a public thing
!samba
i guess so. i just wanna install wine
you should be ok. just remove the lines with backports in them from your [URL]st
i see. no i mean mac address
?
so my mac address for my wlan and eth comes assigned from the manufacturer?
mac addresses are hard coded into the cards by the manufacturer.  yes
okay. thanks.
what are you trying to do?.  [URL]  the ip address is different
No I don't mean when it is installed, I can see it from apt/synaptic.. I want to see when a package was released, preferably without going to package maintainers' website
apt-get changelog packagename
It displays the same text from synaptic.
and what is wrong with that information?
It does say the package version, yes, but not when it was released/made available.
-- Adam Conrad <adconrad@[URL]> Fri, 27 Apr 2012 10:17:02 -0.  that is the changelog from vim, is 27.04.2012 10:17:02 not enough?
Actually, let me try that with another package.
the changelog-syntax is always the same for every package
Hmm, it is easy to see when I try it firefox.. But not for chromium.
-- Ken VanDine <ken.vandine@[URL]> Fri, 07 Sep 2012 17:04:42 -0500.  i dont see the problem, as i said, its always the same syntax, always the last line under the changed
dialup?. what,  ?. do you use dial up conection?
my internet connection is dialup
yes
make/model?
Dell Inspiron 1501.  the problem goes away when i disable onboard lan control and wireless control in my bios, but then i have no network.
check [URL]/ it says hypernate works with a certain bios version and driver compination. theres a chunk on it about 3/4 down the page
thanks i'll have a look
good luck.
@ thanks much!
it would if your pam is segfaulting
:(
Are you able to fix it temporarily?
?
Or do you have to close the whole program
It only does it when maximized, it doesn't do it if it's windowed
Any other strange symptoms occur?
looks like that.
install `gtk-theme-switch'. then run the program `switch'
Thanks, but the specific problem is that if I launch "Plasma" manually it works, but if I login to it from sddm the X server goes black during initialization.  XFCE login from sddm works, so I believe the problem is with the plasma "start" script executed by SDDM. I just don't know where to find it.
Ok, I am not a KDE user, can't help much with that, hopefully someone else in this forum might, wait and see if someone replies, tx
Found it, finally. /usr/share/xsessions
tx for sharing
well, they removed the overscan setting in the nvidia control center and that's why i can't control the position of my hdmi picture anymore, i'm clueless what to do now.
what driver are you currently running?
nvidia-current.  nvidia-current
try doing the info in the 2nd post from this link [URL]
what do you mean, ?
you asked: anyone. I answered all ;-)
clever. you know the answer to my question?
no, i don't tjhink tjhat's possible. UYo uneed the alternate cd.
I don't understand
why you are trying to do so
exxon, I have eth0 and eht1. At one point, I enabled eth1, but now I don't need it and services keep running on eth1.  so I want to disable it so everything will run on eth0
if you are wired with eth0 then there no need for eth1 by the command you give is totally down..let the light blink ..
different .config's?
some things will be yes
yes with Tor. I do all the things people say on ubuntuforums and i still get the same error
What error are you getting ?
YES!. hmm, so that's how you go back to X...
X runs on tty7 by default - normally
lstnares: well it says error in line # please report this bug
please pastebin the full contents of your /etc/apt/[URL]st
Yes It loads the DVD, determins there are several video tracks and subtitles, then ouputs the message "DVD successfully opened" But does nothing else after that
i have installed easyubuntu and everything works
All that wll do is install the libdvdccs script, Which I've already done
sly: [URL]
I would rather not run scripts like that I've heard reports of them trashing systems
sly: ok
would it effect 3d game performance, say doom3?
if the game is written to take advantage of it, yes. I'm not a gamer; I don't know which games use which techniques
Just the URL.. I get a 404.
cadex, what are you trying to install and I'll see if I can hit it
Wine.. Run Windows programs on Ubuntu.
k, just a sec
to login to X remotely. not vnc or teamviewer
Okay what client do you intend on using then?
xdmcp?
[URL]
how did you know that is what i had?
:) I remember reading a few mins before (I aint spying)
thank you for the help!.  ill try it out now
you're welcome.. see the chmod man page. it might help more.... man chmod
dont know why i didnt think of that lol
no problem :-)
yes it worked perfectly. I had like 100 html files on my new web server, and didnt want to go through all of them lol
cool. glad to hear it worked and i could help. you might want to check the permissions of the directory and make sure it's what you want for the directory itself
there has to be some kind of ide for it. kdevelop has that kinda stuff. whats gnome's kdevelop?
sure. but he didn't ask for a IDE
World of warcraft is having some 2-3 second delays, getting really anoying.. was wondering if someone could me sort it out
sorry,, not great with WOW .
I did just find another error when trying to "reload" from synaptic specifically..  can you see that?
yes but what error did you get ?
I'm curious as to what I did to cause this problem, as I've never run into it on previous versions of Ubuntu..  but then again I'm tinkering around more than I used to.
did you see my last pm ?
Yes. What does that do, exactly?
it adds the public key to your trusted keys
Is there something that I did to make that necessary?
you probably added the repo from [URL] without adding the required key
calc:.  to make .deb files with the scripts
hmm dont have a clue :)
how? I don't believe its the /etc/motd. since you havent log into the system yet. I just want it to be completely blank when it ask for username and password
[URL]
Thanks !, but this is after you log in. I'm talking about the screen that you see where it ask for your username and password.
i even had mine setup so on my battery percent was on it.  some of that stuff like the hostname is the stuff that displays before you login
well i just double clicked a .bin file and it said "rename this file to an executable extension"
do you have executable permissions on the file?
actaully yesterday I couldnt get something with apt-get and then was able to get it with aptitude
aptitude adn apt are the same package manager (sptitude is more advanced). atitude*. you know what i mean :(
yeah but it tied to a ip address. that should give you the samething. try to ping that and it will give the translation of what that is
actually open a browser and type 192.168.1.1
well, booting from hibernation takes about the same time as booting fresh in my experience. The main point is that you get back the session you were in
true.
I thank you so much. I'll work on what you have told me
and maybe ffmpeg can be abused for that as well
what do you mean abused ?.  can you expand it little bit.  I think you meant ffmpeg can tell me what kind of file is it am I correct ?
you need to know if the file, that is only partialy uploade is video file or not?is that right? or only prior to transcoding?. *uploaded
you are quite right.  and I am using actually ffmpeg to convert my files.  so in this case what can I do with ffmpeg to find out what the people are uploading
ffmpeg -i somefile should give you some clues.  what info do you need exactly?.  and why?
when the people start uploading I would love to know what they trying to upload is a video file, if it is video file, then let them upload it then use ffmpeg to convert it to *flv.  if not ignore their upload and send them a message
right, hold on
hi, ok like make an iso of data info just for testing cd roms.  i vaguely remember some method of doing that in linux.  i know i can burn it with mkisofs
ok, is this just binary white noise?
yeah
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.out bs=1MB count=100
kewl
this creates 1 MB sized 100 files.  no, one piece file. sorry
so would i make 680mb or so
yes you can.  install dvd+rw-tools, and use dvd+rw-mediainfo to get the exact size of the disk
bs=680MB count=1 or just a bunch of files that add up to 680ish?
no no.  bs=1MB is the memory size, if you increase it you might just crash your pc
oh
that command creates only 1 (one) file but creates in 100 steps of 1MB
ah so thats a help. Ill google
Gnea* get your head out! jk but FTW?. !info anacron
wifi
what kind of wireless card do you have? (do you know how to find out?)
rf to force?
not sure, just know it works. whats the big picture?
i downloaded them to downloads folder. i am used to windows. apt-get couldnt find it or something. so i went to download page
so did you open synaptic pacakge manager and search for those?
but it seperated into extras and backports.  breezy, yes, one good reason.
breezy makes all the backports pretty useless. there will be a breezy backports if they find the time after release though. s/time/motivation

umm lemme check
use gcc -w
will do, thankyou
then use mke2fs.<press tab here> /dev/partition name.  so if the partition is /dev/hdg2, and you want to use fat, you'd use: sudo mke2fs.vfat /dev/hdg2
not converting
i mean convderting fingers and brain as well as files :)
samba, mysql, web
nah not at all
using tp_smapi? last kernel update broke it on my T61
i had to use the external module from the tp_smapi suite.  i don't know about t61, maybe it's too new?.  i don't know about t61, maybe it's too new?
it worked perfectly just prior to the last kernel update
hmm. i am on feisty here but i compiled my own 2.6.22.1 kernel
if its raid i cant install grub :/
if you have raid 1 mirroring, then grub can reliably boot that (but its not actually booting it as raid, its just booting the individual mirror)
yes.. but i cant even installl grub
for raid0 or other stripped raid levels you are best having a boot partition that is raid1 or non-stripped
more specifically, the newest Desktop Ubuntu ISO from the Server Ubuntu console.  is k3b for console?
I am not sure what you mean by console...you mean in terminal?
Yes, terminal
you not have gui?
how is it possible
IU've got it set up like that. I'll tell you but I need to look it up as I do so.
Like I said, segfault.
feel free and paste the error for myself and the other volunteers
10:44 < > So did apt-get update - reading package lists... Error!. Looks like it may be attempting to reboot now...
open a terminal, and run "sudo apt-get update" and paste the *exact* error.. you can copy paste it so myself and the other volunteers can see *exactly* what happens
mind helping out?
ah yes it's python-fstab
that dint help
oh wait it's pysdm maybe, let me check.  yeah that's the one
what should i do??should i download it?
yeah, sudo apt-get install pysdm.  type that at the command line.  then launch it with "sudo pysdm"
thanks man

or share the music folder (if it is legal)
i tryed all i get is menu term
its minimal what did you expect.  you can add items and I belive there is an app/script that will auto add apps
no there should be a cofi file for .fluxbox
cofi?

/home/rob as the link.  /home/rob as the mount
you know that that makes everything that's currently in /home/rob unreachable....
so mount on /home ?
that would make everything currently in /home unreachable :).  simply do ln -s /media/sda3/rob /home/rob/rob. that way you'll get a 'rob' folder inside your homedir
slackin_, not so much. on my machine it doesn't seems to rock
are you using nouvou driver? its junk. go get real nvidia drivers
well, my xfce4 is broken. I'm currently on Unity right now. Was hoping that by removing xfce4, and install it again, it will fix my xfce4
Ah. You can restore Xfce to default settings simply by removing .config/xfce4 from your $HOME.
it's also about ubuntu's config
I'm not saying it's wrong of you to ask here. I'm saying, #vbox is more likely to know
l
L?
like in faiL
Oooh, haha. Thx
ah ok ty
np
alright, tried that but no one seems to be talking in that channel
doesn't make it supported here
not for me, but user wants google-chrome specifically
its coming from the silverlight - flash package - chromium should work but a bit unstable
chromium might do the trick, but additional lib for flash would be necessary
it will be inside already
you mean pepper flash plugin already in the bundle for chromium packet in the repo?
cfhowlett, oh right yeah sorry wrong box
Any success? Mine's scanning 32 hosts, and has been going for a little over an hour, keeps updating "NSE Timing: About 55% done; ETC: 15:12 (1:01:42 remaining) and the remaining keeps increasing
that's very weird, all my scans were almost immediate
8.0.4?. It flew through the port scan portion, it's been doing the NSE Timing thing forever
the nmap in *buntu respositories does not include the smb (conficker) script; I download the latest version and compiled
Yeah, that's what I did.
not sure then, I didn't see anything extraordinary about the NSE timing
what command
the one it gave you .. 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
yep
dunno what is that lemme check. :P
virtual machine, like you have computer inside computer ;) LL
lol
pretty awesome app
inside?? WOW. :D
- nope!
Ok, too bad.  That's what the Ubuntu Base takes up
- as in 'server' install - or the actual base system?
'server'
did you stop it?
in fact I gave my project to the current maintainer, since I had no more time to manage it. I don't know what is the state of the project at this time..  in fact, i did it just for me, then I gave it to the community just in case someone may need it. I didn't expected it to become a long term project
No no, of this pcDuino I have to ssh into...
then just ping it? Open a terminal, type in 'ping 192.168.0.20' and hit enter...
thanks jovi, I'm trying to use as a internet server
again i need to ask. what type of server do you need to install? webserver, ftp server, ssh server...?
no, I have tried installing it without any luck
installing it? it's installed by default
I have upgraded to 8.04 from 7. I think I have it removed atm using ALSA instead
well.. then I don't know what to do.. alsa and I were never on friendly terms
okay.. can you help me installing pulseaudio?
nope.. wouldn't know where to start.. since it's always installed by default I've never had to do it manually
They are
do two drivers show up in the restricted driver manager? b43 and STA?
whatever I do with apt or dpkg or synaptic etc go wrong. Please suggest any simple command for me to execute for geivng output.
please do what I have asked
ok. tks. I go...  [URL]
there's no dpkg error there.  if you want to get rid of the "unable to resolve host ubuntu" message, pastebin your /etc/hosts file
can u be specific. as in what are up side to 13
I suggest you resarch - it's personal taste
it did in windows
sounds almost like a settings issue is there an option or something in teamspeak where you can select sound device and input device?
ya i've tried all of that
some discussion of it in forums [URL]
I don't know.  It should be
then do "file filename.bin", it will tell you..  (it probably isn't)
so not possible/recommended ?
its can cause some very bad problems at timnes.. so i advise getting away from spaces :)
from the website
try the one from the repos, the other one is not supported and as it seems it have not the correct dependencies set
could it be becuase I am on ubuntu ?
no
err. kubuntu
that may be the problem but the bug is a missing dependency in the package from the website.  use the one from the repos.  and maybe fill a bug on there website against there package (if the one from the repos is working)
yeap
which nvidia card are you using?
is. C51 [GeForce 6150 LE].  if I install the drivers the pc gets slow
no?.  which driver you installed? (version)
right but it wont ever boot it. err mount it at bootup. i hav
pastebin your /etc/fstab
/dev/sdb5 /media/sdb5 ext3 user,auto,rw,dev 0 0. is the line i added. everything else works fine
you created the mount point? /media/sdb5
he wants us to use time()
i don't know how, though, but it must be possible in a way
after we hand it in we get the solution key :0. i just wnat to get it right :)
okay, give me a second
k
_only_ time() ?
yup
erm... but time() gives you a unix timestamp. without any other way to measure time more accurately, this is impossible o_O
you'd be whiny too if you'd spent as many hours on this..  which restricted drivers?
any of them ubuntu offers you, google your videocard name, and ubuntu. see what happens
do you mean proprietary drivers from ATi?
if ATI makes your card
thank God for that..lol
lol ^^
dunno how I managed without [URL] in my irssi before..I like that in my statusbar
you use irssi? well :>
ok ill give you my visa # and date, just a sec
lol
for my mouse speed, and my keyboard extra buttons. i couldnt find anywhere to chg speed of mouse, but i added "Resolution" "5000" to Xfreeconfig file, is that right. ya gnome
for your special buttons on your keyboard just open the gnome keyboard panel and find what your programin like vol+ the slect it and press your vol+ key and then contuue till all your keys are configured
ya i found the tool for mouse, but it doesnt have a speed option. zen, where do i get that
keyboard shout cuts
:O!!!! thanks zen that was frightingly fast :S
yep.  for your mouse open the mouse panel and click the last tab
using ATI
Which model though?
on the site it only has the stuff for 8.10 and older.  huh??
!info ubuntu-netbook-remix jaunty
ok thanks ill try that

don't know how to do that one, best of luck
./qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online: cannot open `./qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online' (No such file or directory)
and of `ls -l qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online` ?.  no, I said "file" in front of it. I didn't say ./qt...
asini@icaro:~/Downloads$ file ./qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online. ./qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online: cannot open `./qt-unified-linux-x86-2.0.5-2-online' (No such file or directory)
why are you putting the ./ there?. Just press qt<tab> and it will autocomplete the name. file qt<tab>
Ok, when you accidently execute such a file on your system is there any danger?. Any possibility to scan your system?
.exe files do not run on linux.  again: no reports of cross platform infection via office docs (yet).

Install something called "Emerald Theme Manager." Search Software Center for "Emerald"
ah right, thanks
Do you also have Compiz enabled?. Compiz installed*
not even installed! >_<
Install "Compiz Config Settings Manager" from Software Center and then install Emerald
how do i enable compiz?. okay, how do i enable gtk transparency?
Do you have it installed?
i still need compiz don i?. seems i have it installed, yes
Run in terminal "compiz --replace"
Mardeni: x86, not amd64. which is why I was asking
try to do a sudo apt-get autoremove from the terminal
well they're not installed on my system. I was just wondering what they were used for. Mostly being curious :)
ah, ok. if your looking in synaptic, you can highlight it and see a description of it
"/usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0 -> libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.3". "/usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.3: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped"
cool.  the file is the same, you are just using a link to humour apps expecting the specific filename
yes. but which is less troublesome and more favored by the master developers?. someone recommends: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -f
1. no "master developers" here. 2. if you are unsure what the commands do, read the man pages.
why don't the masters come here?
do you have any other ubuntu support questions?
how can it say such pack is installed if I never installed it and its not there. the damn thing, I even did remove and install again, it did install few megs, but still the stuff isnt there
why are you running as root

yup
I did
ok. then i have no idea.

that's an older version of vbox
I'm using non-free. ok
-ose is the free one.  but the version of it in the repos is older
do u realy think it's normal? I dunno...
it is, if you are using analog instead of digital. what are you trying to record?
tks gonna try it
You need to know the exact package names
sorry it is not a packkage
What is it?
soad: i need to remove all symbolic link so update-alternatives creates
I don't knowe
k. thx. my prince
and if you still don't get it, do :: cp ~/.fluxbox/fluxbox-menu ~/.fluxbox/menu.  i've dealt with this problem
k
and if you still don't get it, google : ubuntu fluxbox menu (you'll see many links)
I just did that. I didn't get the recovery mode though.
dans: you would have to restore the headers of that file more or less by hand, really not a nice job
Unless recovery mode still attempts to load the nvidia drivers. I installed nvidia-xconfig and now I get a black screen where before I was running in low resolution.
.. and only if there is no new data , dans.  : or run sudo init 1, it'll bring you there , too, maybe your grub is configured to not display these kernel-lines ?
I can't run anything because nothing is visible on the screen
ctrl+alt+F1 ?
I can see the login prompt flash for about a tenth of a second and then it goes black for 5 seconds, and it repeats.  tried that too. No response. I'll reset the [URL]nf using the live cd i guess. And hopefully a distribution upgrade from 10.04 LTS will take me to 11.04 without any serious issues
do you get the boot-menu at all on left shift ?
I get nothing. I've tried holding down the key since hitting the reset button, or tapping it repeatedly. get the same result every time. i'm not too surprised that 10.04 LTS can't support the newer hardware. But I was a bit surprised that installing 11.04 didn't work at all. I suppose I could burn a third CD and install 10.10 ... >_<
you can chroot for reconfiguring grub, if resetting xorg doesn't work and make it boot to init 1 default
not that one, it was a cat of a proc file or something, but i
lsb_release -a , without the 's' xD
not that one, it was a cat of a proc file or something, but i'll try yours!
don't know xD
well whaddayaknow, i now have dapper
lol, you kinda old xD. anyhow, anyone knows something about subtitles not being showed correctly? [URL]
hmm... let me look... is it in the skype options?
no
oh.. its via the config file
yes
well at least the are getting recognized, you may have some key sequence or something to enable them idk
ok, cool, thank you
have you checked system settings/display and see if they show up there
yes, they don't. I read somewhere that people where having problems getting screens recognized with this laptop, just can't remember where. Could it have to do with the fact I'm using nouveau drivers instead of nvidia?
And I don't have bandwidth to rebuild my dev environment to test if it breaks my app
try /var/log/apt/term.log for the actual terminal output. it will say unpacking xyz version over abc version
Well the the update is in version control
i probably misunderstood your quetsion lol
restart?
the "Disks program"
I have installed network-manager-gnome -- what next?
right-click on your gnome panel and choose "add to panel"
:)
im a stupidhead. it was tsclient, so easy mistake. does that mean it is not installed at all?.  the isntall script said it installed.
look at /opt/teamspeak.  look at /opt/TeamSpeak2 or something like that
nope.  i am going to try to manual install it
you can type a folder where to install it and you should know where
gtg
That's the thing though, I didn't remove anything.
check /var/log/apt/history.log. maybe it got removed somehow
I'll take a look... this is just so peculiar.. I found the culprit, I wish I could see the user who initiated the command: "apt-get remove python"
/var/log/auth.log
ohk...
all linux can just read, not just ubuntu.
there is no way to write ?
not one that's stable. It's because we're having to reverse engineer the ntfs filesystem.
ok thanx  ?. *!
sigh. this is going to take a while.
yes ._.
thats hardware, try ##hardware for support
desktop. ty
Hrm... this is on the default GNOME desktop, correct?
looking at nautilus options
Here's a hack you could try: [URL]  Don't run that, I think that disables right click system wide though.
ur awesome. and I am glad you are here in this chat
aww, thanks
I don't think so.... well all's well that ends well I guess :)
Where did you even get these kernels?. :)
probably apt-get install linux-generic. it installed all 3. "just in case" (?). big thanks to ChogyDan  meris
I've never had that happen to me, but all good. Glad that it's set. So you know, the original thought installing compat-drivers would have worked as well, but way more convoluted and troublesome upgrades.. I remember not too long ago, being required to build the kernel for most anything.. You did get a a sense of customization though, not this simple, oh, new module, i'll type modprobe.... night
ah that worked perfectly!. thanks. and what is that command to add mp3 support to everything
dont forget to set the 'default/primary' monitor in the nvidia-settings tool also.  i always install 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' that adds a lot of things.
yezzir
where can i get it?
i doesnt
!find Tahoma
!find Tahoma
The other's aren't free either..  You can always copy Tahoma*.ttf off Windows and put them in ~/.fonts/
ntfs
!ntfs >  (see the private message from ubotu)
carlfk so i put host [URL]?
no, type that.
connection time out. no servers can be reached. actually i couldn't connect to gaim just a bit ago either. i tried eth0 up and eth0 down
your DNS settings are hosezed
It has the extension directory pointing to the right place. Restarting apache makes no difference.
smashcat: don't you have to tell php to include the modules you just d/l'ed, i don't think it _auto-includes_ the extensions just b/c they're in the directory. smashcat: in your ini - extension=[URL]
>: what do u mean?
if you want to edit or build your web design
im on ub untu. ubuntu
in Ubuntu there's a Kompozer
thanks
previously NvU
Ah, hm.... Any idea how I'd figure out which partition?
what does "fdisk -l" show?. That's "sudo fdisk -l", sorry
[URL]  [URL]
"Compaq diagnostics", it says..  I'm guessing, unless "Compaq diagnostics" is what you call your porn directory, nothing important.
Thanks
no problem
There are none listed. So I got the one from ATis site downloaded
what card do you have?
An ATi Radeon X850XT
sorry to tell you but your card's support has been dropped by the latest release of ati's drivers
Yes but this is the 9.3 that I have downloaded. It says that it's compitable with my card.  The latest release is 9.5
only 9.4 or 9.5 drivers will work with jaunty
Seriously?
yes we have had to tell a lot of people this.  you'll have to talk to ati about it, but you could try the open source driver
great, thanks.  that's what i'm looking for
i wouldn't use gzip if the database is not well compressible
no? why not?
waste of time to compress already compressed data
I'm using an external display so I set "workspaces_on_primary_only" to false. but when I connect/disconnect the display, it all goes to the primary one
i manage my monitors via the Display app.  ive never had to mess with any conf
when you press the home key do they all go to the same screen?
i think so, i dont have the laptop with me at the moment
that's what I don't want. I want the windows on the external display to go to that display. not to the main one
maybe gnome-tweek-tool has something that can help?
already tried that. it resets whenever I unplug
i used the unity tweek tool to create hot corners. ah ok.  i see someone on suse that made gnome3 behave more like gnome2 to get that functionality back.  he also doesnt show us at all how he managed to do it either, so thats nice.
link please
[URL]  this is not on the topic of this chat room, however..  oh he has a link, scriptblock was stripping it from my page. there's some instruction on the jump..  what do you know, gnome tweek tool to the rescue :)
yeah I already tried it
no luck?
the thing is, when I disconnect the monitor, it reverts back to all windows on the same screen
and you have to re-do all your settings all over again?
so i should get a lilo menu now?
it won't do any harm to "sudo lilo" first - just to make sure
Added Linux *. Added LinuxOLD
I nearly had a heart attack when, after removing the 2.6.10 kernel it tried to run grub! Last time it ran grub, I couldn't boot anything for about the next 12 hours....  the '*' is the default
okay. so if i run into trouble upon reboot... i can pass arguments to lilo?
nope!
..Okay.
if neither of those two boot, you'll need to boot using a CD or something...
oh really
yeah, several hundred projects applied
upgraded my kernel
doh!
never seen that before in linux
seems to be mounted on a device, plus a module. news to me
ok
/dev/shm doesn't seem to require very much though :)
so?. whats the command to "index" ther bin-path after apt-get install so that I can run the app without logging off ? thanks
I just told you.... updatedb
oh. well im still learning ...lol ..im just trying to install the things he needs ...he said he wants his phone tools ...lol
notice that everything on the page describes the search terms
solved
Sure.
[URL]
is that jump drive a 4gb drive.. that looks like it's hooking up to /dev/sdb ?. or is that another drive on your system all together?.  lets hope someone else jumps in with a more practical answer than me :)
Its an usb flash drive of 4 GB. I will just reformat it
gparted is easy to use, easy enough for me to figure out :)
haha, yeah, that's what I thought :)
i assume it's all just cached webpages/databases?
I guess that's impossible... The site isn't serving pages... should I restart apache?. drebellion: possible I mean
i have no idea.
[URL] < <unconvertable> this is what gnustep-base's configure says. notably, it seems to be searching for ffi.h. which locate doesn't seem to think exists
interesting..it does say incomplet support for ffi... did you try the configure with the --wity-ffi-include.  rather --with-ffi-include
well locate can't find an ffi.h. so...
well did you try the compile without the invocatoins to see if it still complains??
internal
then run lspci in a terminal
I know "find" itsself can do a lot of cool stuff, but I tend to mostly pipe its output out to grep and things. like the pipe to xargs there
Find is hard to master. Especially because it uses X-style parameters.
Ah really, never knew that, no wonder I found it hard to find in synaptic before
oh.. I'm not sure if the synaptic search box is case sensitive.. but when running stuff from the terminal you need to use the right case.. (which in most cases are lower case)
Sweet man, I'm all good now, thank you very much :)
you're welcome
Radeon HD 6290
then you have a choice between radeon and fglrx. choose your poison. radeon probably still has awful powermanagement
hang on .  I'm not used to IRCing. Do you want me to paste the info on the site?. This is what I get with "lsusb":
to a paste service: [URL] the save and give us the browser link; this avoids flooding the channel
Bus 002 Device 006: ID 19d2:0117 ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM. got it
so the eight character ID is the one to search for the chipset
im not sure is there a init script that does it on boot?. In the (far distant) past (not on ubuntu) i wrote my own startup script
do you need it on boot? or is after boot ok?
after is fine.  perhaps before fstab get read?
well if you have a configuration file for mdadm, it will assemble the array for you automatically. Then having it in fstab, it will mount.  i havent used mdadm for a while. Just do raid with servers. And then i prefer hardware raid..  i believe mdadm will be called automagically before fstab
heh not in my budget :).  ok cool
yeah same for me I guess if i would ever want it on something wich is mine. Make sure to enable mailing so you get status updates on how your array is doing.
i'll give it a shot - box is in use atm so i didnt really want to test with a reboot.  reading the manpage you look spot on though
happy I could be of help. Just verify that it works. Last time i used sw raid in linux it failed me....
interesting, now i don't see the ipv4 address (seems the deletion worked) but now i cannot ping6 as well :-S
was ping6 working before ?
i tried using the hex code in fdisk (much longer than ef00) and it showed up as "EFI". do I need to explicitly use this ef00 type?
i think you should use gdisk, not fdisk
ok, how do I set code as ef00 though?
under Code column you should see EF00
ok I did it. ill try boot-repair again now
in gdisk "t change a partition's type code"
yes I did it.  but boot repair still doesn't recognize this partition. 1 2048 411647 200.0 MiB EF00
sorry i don't know how to restore it. somebody else can probably help. maybe grub-install would work(?)
thanks anyway.  but would grub-install restore the EFI files and everything?
no idea
actually I think mounting the EFI partition and running grub-install was all that was necessary.  I will try to reboot now
is your efi partition empty?.  before grub-install?
the card is listed in ifconfig and I see modules for it in lsmod, but I don't see any wireless networks listed. and I definitely should.
you may need to download the firmware
I've made sure it's not blocked by rfkill, it was listed as being blacklisted in /etc/modprobe.d/[URL]nf but I commented it out
look for the firmware put it in the appropriate place and then remove and reinsert the driver module
I have the firmware downloaded for it using firmware-b43-lpphy-installer
ok
this is part of the output of my dmesg : b43-phy0: Loading firmware version 666.2 (2011-02-23 01:15:07)
ok did you reinsert the driver module
yes I think so. I did modprobe -r b43 && modprobe b43
ok .. seems like you're fine ... are you not able to use the device still
RIGHT, so that's why I'm sitting here scratching my head. It isn't the hardware switch.
hmm ..
no, the device shows up, the modules are loaded, but I see no wireless networks and I should see plenty. There's a wireless router about 2 feet from this machine.
this might help .. [URL] ok .. that is strange ..
yeah, its about time. with a 7 second boot. !pastebin.  does this look better ? [URL]
yes indeed
I was starting to get depressed i7 (admittedly only a 720m laptop obviously with 16gb ram) it really didn't make me happy.  thanks for all the help!!!
heh, i hardly did anything, you fixed it yourself :p
test errors. i just need to uninstall one of them. either 2.6.4 or 2.6.3 either one. i just dont know hwo. how*
I'd uninstall the one you just compiled
no way to pin a menu to the side bar thing?
The Unity dash's "Applications" tab is the menu, no?. Well, in an alternative form, for sure, but it's still got the hierarchy preserved and stuff
seriously?
yes, quite spectacularly.
adhoc wireless is two wireless devices (i.e. laptops) in a sort of peer to peer mode.  no wireless router needed...if that makes sense
okay I don't have anything like that
well it is occasionally useful...just left click nm-applet and create wireless network....well that used to work, seems broken now
I have a wireless router -- i am running dd-wrt
Nope
or some other process might have a file open on it
lsof | grep windows. No results.
hm ok, that's me stumped then sorry
what if it is a long path?
Then 'cd "$PWD" ' should still work.
indeed thanks ;0. :)
You're welcome
thanks.  hehe, but I guess it grows over the years
trim out the modules you need.. to speed it up..  also i recall that 'distcc' could spread it out to other machines. and gain speed as well
not sure about what's marillat. the repository?
yes. [URL] i think is what it is listened as.... err listed
grep says there isn't anything in [URL]st about marillat or nerim
what package isn't installable then?
amsn i think, i'm not sure
well if you can't give us details about the problem we can't really help.
thanks ... but, then I need do the download of the packages, ubuntu not offer cds with packages, how eg. the mandriva and slackware
the dvd has the main and restricted repositories, but not universe and multiverse
very good, then, the DVD is more complete. Where I found a list of the packages in the DVD ?
[URL]
thaniks
anything from main or restricted afaik
As I stated, I'm using 10.04 aka Lucid
then you dont need any jaumty repos/entries in your sources. remove them
it was with fiesty.  you just apt-get lvm2 and then modprobe the kernel module
ahhh. oh yeh of course
thanks.  do you think it sounds like a hardware issue?.  I see nothing in syslog. Nothing in kern.log either
As it happens with all OSes... maybe. Maybe you also put too many devices on one hub. Like two resource hungry USB devices.
tasksel tasksel/first multiselect ubuntu-mate-desktop, print-server
and how you are doing it after?
kk sry
have you tried changing the output plugin in xmms ?
ya i tried
have you tried a different application?
wat do i try. xmms wrked fine sometime bak. neways wat do i put output pluggin
erm -"worked fine" on this install? I would try the esound output plugin
you think it would work from a virtual environment to a rl situation too?\.  then I could create the RAID1 out of my firewire disks and then port it too the real thing
sure, the disks will be setup, the raid will just have to be moved and the raid config setup in the new system
how did you do that?
went to terminal and did sudo -i. so now it says root@username
that's bizarre - what are you typing?
then I tried to drag a plugin into /usr/share/audacity/plug-ins. whats bizre?. bizzrfe. bizzare
by clean i meant to delete the stored packets
stored packages?.  check the man page for apt-get; afaict, that's what clean does
yes lotss.  yes lots
please  can you advise me. am not very good in all this
!repo.  so where should be list?
System>Adminstration>Software Sources
i know that but there is no default list on that trigger !repo
Why should there be?
oh yes
oops i mean security
thanks, let me check it
sorry Im talkin about installing
AH. and if it is already installed?
choose recovery mode from grub and when you get a menu, choose failsafe X
[URL]  That's exactly my problem.  But I couldn't really understand the solution
this is a ubuntu channel not a redhat channel
Same problem, different OS
so you not using ubuntu then?
I am
are you familiar with manager users and groups ?.  managing *
No
[URL]
I'm using SSH, that link is of no use to me
not my problem. install links2
Never mind, there is a command line part.  So, do I add the user to the group "tty" as instructed on the foruM
no idea. i don't run game servers. but without a basic understanding of how to manipulate users and groups you're not going to get very far
i ran "pwd" it returned: /media/AcidShower/FTP/jkdf2
thats why then.  you are sat in the mount, so you cannot unmount it
it doesn't uninstall dhclient, which is used before dhcpcd
so uninstall it manually
then network-manager is uninstalled, which kills networking altogether.  ubuntu ships with 4 dhcp clients, but there appears to be no documented way of actually using anything other than dhcp3-client
I bet it's a debian alternative
thanks, i will check it :)
first thing i check is apt-cache search openoffice | grep python
but i'm too good to make mistakes like that :p
Yes, you just proved that, didn't you? :p
amarok cant play radio streams i think
it can im doing it right now ;0
ahhh
just type the url in the 'action->play media->location' box
will check it up then :)
vlc can too. but vlc crashes a lot for me
that doesn't show how to change the theme
it does. look harder
and its login screen, not login window as it used to be till jaunty
?.  go to local in that and chagne theme
i don't see any "login window" in my karmic's system > admin, i see "login screen" and it doesn't allow me to change theme, it just allows me to enable/disable automatic login and change timeout
aah sorry karmic yeah its not possible.  damn.  because the gdm is separate now :(.  dont know this one
yup.. but there should be a way to do it..
how about the gdm screen itself?.  there any options below?
i set the path in my zsh profile and my bash profile, but gnome can't execute the apps
which zsh file did you use?
git_think.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Wed Jul 23 06:04:30 2014
right, so gzip compressed tar file. How exactly are you trying to extract it?.  tar -xf should technically auto-detect the compression and do that for you,.  else try tar -xzf git_think.tar.gz
first I tried tar -xvzf file, then I tried "tar -xzf file"
if that doesn't work: make sure the file isn't compromised / broken (e.g. due to a faulty download. See if there is an md5 sum or something you could use to check).  try -xf, recent versions of tar should, in theory, auto-detect the compression.  if that doesn't work, chances are that the file is a bit broken (if other .tar.gz files work fine)
tried -xf, it is giving no response from long time, I have not stopped, it seems like doing something in background, but as it has been enough time I doubt it
add the file after f :p.  tar -xf git_think.tar.gz
yes I added tar -xf file
if that does something: see if extracted files appear. if yes: good. If not: it might really be broken (the file). If you downloaded it: try re-downloading / check the md5sum or similar if available
before this .tar file , I ran this command on .txt file by mistake after it exited with same status, after that is same for .tar file too :(
is that a public available file? If so: where from? I can see if it works here.
no compiz
have you put in any widgets?
nothing first time trying the application.  I noticed that there is a version 0.36 but its only compiled for the i386 archietecture and i have 64bit
aha
i'm connecting from windows. what do you mean running x?
you need to be running an x server on windows if you want to use X11 forwarding
i am
which one?
xming
did you enable it on the server?
yes, ssh_config and sshd_config both have all X11 forwarding options set to 'yes'
don't know then, never used windows for X11 forwarding.  make sure you restarted sshd after changing options in its config
alright. could it be i have my display variable set incorrectly?
what is it set to?
localhost:0:0 is what I have in putty for x11 forwarding to
try just "localhost:0"
ok. serverside and clientside?
where will you set it serverside?
I honestly can't remember, I think I used some kind of package.  I know I didn't use apt-get
bah. If apt-get wasn't involved there may be no clean way to get rid of it again.
It's just that it's stuck in my Applcations menu bar and I want it gone
as an icon on the bar? Does just right-clicking the icon and saying "remove" not work?.  (I can't give you the exact wording, the install I'm currently in is not english)
I tried the command it gave me (/opt/cx/office/bin/cxuninstall as root).  and it gives me this: cxuninstall:error: unable to determine how to uninstall CrossOver Linux Professional.  and when I right click on it, it does nothing
really more of a crossover question than an ubuntu question if you didn't use apt-get or the like to install it....  if the icon doesn't respond to right-click I'm not sure what icon it is. Is it in the bar (panel) or is it inside the "applications" menu?
It is inside the Applications menu.  Oh don't worry I managed to work it out :).  but could you possibly help with one last thing
just ask the channel...
okay, thanks. how do I delete directories via kernel?
I don't follow. "via kernel"? What are you actually trying to do?
remove a directory, if I try to just right click and go remove it says I need the permission.  Don't I have to remove using a sudo command?
sudo rm -rf /path/to/directory (but make 100% positively absolutely sure there is no typo in the path! tab-completion is your friend here)
the problem is it was the same one i had installed
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean
i did a fresh intrepid install last week.. been using 2.6.27-7. yesterday the update pulled down linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic and all the related headers. there is only one entry in my grub list
sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add the previous version manually
Right. But this answers my question only partially.
I'm not up to date on the bugs of that program. All I can say is that if I saw an app giving me different information than some cli program. I'd trust the cli program
ploooop: Yes. I even tried removing it and reinstalling it. (I already have all the sound drivers, but I shut down VMWare inappropriately and it fudged up how Linux interacts with the sound card)
ahh, you're using vmware.  kinda problematic... when you're doing soundcards.  I never got it to run properly with my soundcard nor my video device
ploooop: No, I had it all fine, but when my computer froze, I had to reboot... After that, all the sound in linux is static while in VMWare sounds just fine.
mmm, yea... someone help corrupted, out of my field.  yea, not really my field
NZ
Damn kiwis!. :P
thanks
!info libasound natty. right.
can i apt-get azureus
sudo apt-get install azureus
thats not what I mean. Since 10.10 evolution shows reply's nested below the first message, but I want to disable this and just have the newest mails on top
try disabling Click View > Group By Threads
ah of course, thanks a lot!
cheers.
reboot :)
and what device is missing exactly under dev?. the dm-* device?
well when I set it up I had the VG in /dev but now after reboot it's gone. but I now found it under /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname. so it's ok I guess
thats where is belongs =)
yeah just that LVM showed me fancy smancy /dev/vgname/lvname
that should be a link to the dm-* devices.  that should also be there afaik but that path uses the folder (vgname) and the volume as a link to the dm-* file.  still weird though if what you say actually happend the devices dissapeared and reappered - without any other change
.. thanks ... so right from Vista I can do just instal ubuntu 64 bit ... and it does all I need ... other than back up of files just in case ?
well,  i'm about to install ubuntu on a work machine and i'm gonna back up everything, on a full recovery disk. as well as transferring all files to a removable hard drive, because i'll then want to transfer them back onto the machine after install
it's a macbook pro 10,1, so it has a dual GPU intel + NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M
install nvidia-319 what version of ubuntu is this?
Ubuntu 13.10. From the command line?.  nvidia-319, not nvidia-319-updates?
nvidia-319
what do you mean?
compiz will have a very wide desktop and one desktop will go across all 3. you spin it, and you'll move to the next..  it wont move the contents of one monitor to the next monitor. all 3 monitors will change at once
oh. wild
this is why i hated multiple monitors when i used compiz
is their something more appropriate than compiz i should be using?
for 3d desktop? ehh... kwin can do 3d desktop but i dont know how it handles multiple monitors for that
i guess the 3d isn't essential, although i would hate to go back from at least using the gpu for compositing. back to the dark ages so to speak
heh hey i love the "dark ages" of tiling window managers ;-)
from cd, yes
have you checked the CD?
yes i did. and it's repeatable, too
no errors?
ie. i'm going thru the exercise a second time, same result
any errors?
of course not, had the check found any i'd have replaced the cd
have you looked on the other text consoles for error messages when the installation stalls?
cool thx .  and to reverse that?
s/hold/unhold/
thanks i will take a look.  which post am i supposed to be looking at?
try first cheese
cyrano_de I have witht he ubuntu ones, I'll just manually install it later. cyrano_de yes, said both were busy still. cyrano_de I get 4 errors on boot now about blocks
So the mdadm --create did not complete?.  4 errors on which devices?
k - good i got one now how do i use it?
cross-platform installer.  open the directory in firefox, and click on the file
well, will have* if i find a cable
i get my stuff from [URL] ....that is, if you want to wait a little bit
sudo rm -r /var/log/samba/*
try "find /var/log/samba/ -exec rm '{}' \;"
thanks, that was what I was after
np
thanks!
no probs. i always forgot (on debian) so i keep it somewhere sane. ..and it came in handy for ubu :)
it's worked before until today so maybe i installed a plugin or something
did you update today?
no.  the videos start for about 3 seconds and then just stop. they continue to download but won't play past 3 seconds
I would think that might be a loose heatsink or fan not working - the software is there to run the vid
now apt-get alsa-base
It's already the latest version.
oh right.. install alsa-utils from synaptic instead
It's already installed
ok..... another moment.  are u able to run alsaconf?
Yes
did it spit out anything?
When I first ran it?
no. this time
modinfo: could not find module snd. then it goes into the config.
then make the changes in the config that u think is necessary
like what =/
thank you very much  that worked
btw, I never noticed any difference between emacs and xemacs, so you might want to try emacs
sounds good
veen - also have a 386 (no clue on speed in mhz) with 64k ram :)
wow, running linux?
veen - put it together from how i found it... haven't felt brave enough to plug it in :). I'm hoping it'll run, i'll donate it to my schools cs department running linux or something
Not really, just worried it didn't uninstall correctly.
you could run "apt-cache policy xubuntu-desktop" to find out each package in it, then remove all those
no it installed just fine as i have it set up to a wired connection but on reboot it wouldent even pick up the wired connection i checked the cable and there were no problems, i had to remove the package to get internet back
maybe try "sudo apt-get update --fix-broken" see if it will replace broken/missing parts..
topper is that the whole command?
... yes that's the whole command... it'll check for broken packages
topper alright, well i run my OS off of a USB (hardrive failure and its much cheaper) so ill try that out later, cause im on a desktop computer atm XD
k... good luck with it, it that command doesn't fix it, it won't make it worse....
topper thanks and if need be i have many back ups of my system so i can always reinstall if anything goes wrong
backups are always a good thing ;)
watcha mean?. i upgrade from lts to ocelot ... just making sure i don't need to change grub or install an update kernel
dont bother. 3.xx was released as a jubilee edition. 20 years of linux.  no new functionality or serious improvements were made
that doesn't work either. status: Unknown job: foo
service is for sysvinit
service is also for systemd.. service is also a generic wrapper that calls your init's binary of choice.
thought it's systemctl
nope, service still works. for backwards compatibility.
I see
err but umm umm yes. if I type in this
xmouse something IIRC
It made the first one shut down out of the blue. Twice. The second one it is simply hung on the booting screen.. I could try it on this one, but somehow I have less than high hopes.. The only thing I've found that works every single time is partition magic, but unfortunately I can't find a torrent for that that is bootable.
i have used on three different machines
glad you have better luck.
have you tried any "cheat codes" ?
I'm using intrepid. ifconfig says eth0 is already my interface. How do I do that?.  Thx
try sudo ifconfig eth0 up
Yes, it worked. Thanks you so much!
np!
I don't see anyting under the apps tab in any of the sub catergories that says nautilus
in gconf-editor, right?
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not Ubuntu Savvy
alt-f2 and type "gconf-editor" in the box
correct
so your rule won't show up there :P
how do i add that table ?
To view it? Hang on
nm, think i got it.. its the nat table, and i googled how to view that table : iptables -t nat -L
sudo iptables -L PREROUTING.  That too according to the man page.  That is the example in the man page under -L You should probably read the man page instead of asking others to read it for you :P
really ?
yep
Yes ..
and emerald?
ubuntu bit like windows keep changing stuff lol
oh my yes. It can be frustrating.. the whole init / upstart thing would be painful to an RHEL type
basically Im a red hat based server admin and Ive been asked to look at an ubuntu server thats borked but theres a few differences in locations service names stuff like that
LTS is for production. The regular distro is actually pretty bleeding edge.  what's the prob. exactly?
you cant get more bleeding edge than Fedora :D
yes but that is RPM ... ANATHEMA!
its just the thinks like no chkconfig I need an ubuntu guide for red hat users :D
you can install chkconfig but it doesn't work with everything
I know but this aint my box. and the problem is tty1 dies whenever you try to login
you can use update-rc.d
even if its using upstart for tty1 ?
udo update-rc.d -f daemon remove <- like chkconfig daemon off
arent all LTS .04
yes but not all .04 are LTS
I just copied a bunch of files from a remote PC to my local PC .... both running ubuntu 8.10
ok, and?
Yes, I know that, but what should I put in there? The default "Thunderbird" setting is wrong because it tries to open a new Thunderbird each time I want to send mail.
It shouldnt do that, it happens to me sometimes
Do you use Thunderbird too?.  On Hoary? And is the line in your preferred applications "mozilla-thunderbird -mail %s"? (that's the default for TB)
yes. I use preffered apps and it works fine. but hold on let me give you a link
I'm guessing you know a script that does it right? I know about that solution... I was hoping that Ubuntu had made a neat package or something that takes care of it..  But if you have a link, please paste it. That should help.
sorry i cant find the link right now , it was on newsforge a week ago
thanks, i'll swapoff and then swap it back on
swapon
kk
in kde there's a gui tool for it, not sure about gnome.  after that, go to gnome-terminal, cd DEBS
, k im with
then type "sudo dpkg -i *.deb". without the quotes
dr_willis, nothing easy to use ? :D
i find vim very easy to use. 160li<space><escape> (i think). then . to repeate it over and over.. (i think)
there's auto mode, local mode, and utc mode.. lemme try
[URL]
systemctl status networking. (for reading status). you can also type: systemctl restart NetworkManager
NetworkManager is not installed
I want the edges of the touchpad to work as a scroller for Firefox, OpenOffice, etc.
negativespace: perhaps ...[URL] http://gentoo-[URL] something ;). chucky: just make him use another dns
Thanks, these look really useful.
negativespace: yw, hope it helps ;)
funny :).  but really >_>.  If i flick my lighter and put it near it I can see the flames and if I point it at light sources i can barely see them
What i mean is try turnong the lighting up and see what happens to the output.  hmm weird
I put a light source right in front of it and its barely visible and you cannot see my face less than 10 inches away with 3 lights on in the room
thats terrible.. i have no ideas sorry
most lib i googled is almost 3 years old. yeah
well id3 hasnt really changed ...
i'm not sure, is there a safer way so to speak?
why is it not safe?
if you say it can hang. I tried the X11 something, it's not working anymore it worked in the previous install for some reason
if you put an ampersand on the end of the line, it will background the command and not hang
: i've follow a lot of HOW-TOs ,it's not working with me .. how to get usb support in VirtualBox ? ,i am using hardy
you need to specify the exact errors you got; as I said the ose does not support that
: it was working with me in 7.04
that is not info to help us
: i was following http://www.ubuntu-[URL] and it not working.
which step is 'not working'
ah, i did it... dunno how. the propietary driver was causing me issues then i moved to the free one again
Are you having trouble with your graphics driver?
it is unveliebable that the proprietary driver was worse tha the oss one. yes with ATI. but i just purgued it following a guide then reinstalled the core and it seems like working now
So what's wrong?
is that to me, none?
yah
Recovery mode works, I can access a shell.
looks like graphics problem did u something with that recently ?
Ed: gmplayer says it was compiled without GUI options..
this is screwed
As well as my modems. But one of my modems doesn't show.
well it's probably a winmodem.
It's not a winmodem, it's a USB adsl modem. It works fine, but it doesn't show there.
well, it's not perfect..  wait, adsl?
Can I add stuff? eg: [URL]
are you using Oneiric?
I need to do a network monitoring of disk space and usage......how do I find out then ?
well you can still check disk usage of mount points.  using commandline> du /mount/point.  man du for more info, its useful for disk usage (lol)
well the disk usage is gonna be done by a Network management system, I just need to setup the different areas to check
there are a bunch of net moniters out there also.  well mount points are viewed as part of the tree, when mounted, so shouldn't be too hard.  they show as if native to that disk.  in my experience)
ok, it's just that the NMS ask to setup in [URL]nf, the different partitions, so I was looking to find them so I can add them
so it is monitoring based on partitions?.  not folders or files?
it monitors disk space, based on the partition (full size, used size....and sends alarms based on a percentage I will setup (<90%, for eg)
hmm in that case it may act different
here's the link [URL]
well it looks like you can specify file locaitions there so you could set it to monitor a mount point.  is this a live network? commercial? I would try a few thing, set some alarms low and see what happens
So i can manually edit the data or only see the data?
exiv2 - EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation tool
thanks
yes to both.. :) depending on the tool
lets ssee
apt-cache search exif. shows several dozen tools.
so are they mainly cmd line or also some with gui>
look at the list. I see some of each.
thank you
many image gui tools seem to mention the feature
i mounted manually and yes is the actual drive
just checking :)
actually.. I just installed Dungeons of Dredmore via steam via wine, no sound..
Do you have sound from other sources?.  Or have you tried yet?
Not yet
open a terminal and type alsamixer
all source files? or all working files were deleted?
Like, the original .avi was just basically gone.. Dunno why.
it has an option to delete the working files... hrm, I will copy-paste the file somewhere now... but... this is taking HOURS... perhaps I selected an option? I am just making 1 avi, to a DVD, split into chapters on 10 minute intervals...
Hmm, I'll look into that next time I try it..  And yeah, maybe you did select something.. :/ I dunno though.. I thought I chose the best quality.
hehe
i guess it shows they are tough by not including easter eggs. i never really thought of easter eggs on linux. haha
thnx, I'll look into that
Basically, if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then command; othercommand; fi
gksu or gksudo?. one i heard is bad
i said it three times. gksu
and i have asked why when i do so it doesnt work.
You need to set up the XP box as a server.
have the script open a terminal window and run something
yes go tot he directory where the script is and ./scriptname.  that basically means run here ./
LightDM??
if so edit /etc/lightdm/[URL]nf
you got lucky.  im having trouble forwarding my ports
ah, did you check out the official wiki?
yeah been there.  i get all green lights at the bottom
odd.  so you just can't dl anything?
dht is working it shows 2000+ seeders and leechers but no download or upload at all
i have no idea...have you tried other torrents?
really? and does it work well in amd64?. the flash i've been using causes flash content to go grey after some time
reasonably well; adobe still doesn't have "stable" 64-bit flash, and truthfully flash sucks pretty bad on anything other than windows :(
yeah....  do you know if there is any flash counterpart which is open source. ?. just asking...
gnash?
i mean like some language
though it is not current as flash is a moving target
anyway, it doesn't matter...
javascript :). <video> in HTML5
how about flash 9?.  you seem like a web designer.. are you?. to be*
I do a lot of #drupal development
what ? i want to add prolog syntax highlight, thats all :'(
yes, so you make gtksourceview aware of that
yeah it is a em250
didnt hp buy them so its probly just a knockoff hp mini built cheaper
i think acer bought them
i say other then maybe the wifi all netbooks are built the same so most everything if not everything should work
ok thanks
and being its a acer knocker off the aspire one works out of the box linux i assume the emachine uses the same base hardware
i want it to be ext3.  its a second drive i want it to be a bump for media files
you can install gparted, delete the partition and then make it ext3
do you know of any documentation on using gparted, im hours new to linux..
i have it installed here, and it's pretty easy, we can help you
What does that mean at install time? Doesn't linux always support multiple users if you create accounts for them?
yes it does, but things like gnome etc can be less happy.  for that matter, things like sshd, or even multiple keyboard/monitor support
can u open a bit??
linuxboy, if the driver's working, you should be able to activate it in your Networking manager.. sorry linuxboy
So can I kill it by killing gpm. ?
Only in the consoles, not in the GUI.
I see, tnx
1.8 will prolly be meerkat for sure- im on 1.8 in Arch right now (testing branch). But hal is a different story. Ubuntu will work without hal, but a lot of apps wont. XFCE for example needs hal.  ^
been using 1.8 on arch for some time as well. doesn't seem like 1.7 wants to support multitouch on my touchpad *cry*
people complain its unstable, but i havent had a more stable version of Xorg personally- havent had an issue yet
tried it didn't work. i've completely removed and reinstalled it, still no luck
so youve done a apt-get update, apt-get upgrade from the command line recently?
fiefox
firefox (then press enter)
gnome
well there's your problem
do I need to uninstall the current version
no, if that command works, no
I'll give it a shot. LJL: It said that my version could not be found. I'm have ruby 1.8.6 and I want to go back to 1.8.5. Are the packages available on the ubunut repositories once there is an update?
they are, but only if there *was* an update. ruby1.8 was never updated AFAICS - it was 1.8.6 right when Gutsy was released
yes i do, just like after i did this update it messed up everything and now i just need to enable it, just dont remember the commmand
one second
ohk
do you have the compiz settings in System > Prefs > whateveritscalled?
it loads and loads and loads and I believe it times out after a while... seems me like a "I'm blocked-scenario"
are you leaving the tab open or ignoring it?
when you select the user one will appear below
you just saved my life, and earned me an hour sleep, thanks!
i dont use it, but according to my little sis it works great.
I'm having little luck finding it; got a link?
how do i do that ? i am newbie to ubuntu...
sudo gedit /etc/modules.  (in terminal)
and just past : sudo modprobe ath_pci at the top ?
no u write juste the name of the module : ath_pci
con: same as mine
any ideas?
when I try cat it says command not found
you're on a terminal, probably /home/brian and cat somefile says command not found?
i did same or worse results
and is ubuntu restrited installed?
gnome-screensaver-preferences didn't do much
or go into appearance in the menu. My netbook with ubuntu 10.10 suspends every time I pull the AC cord out. Anyone know how to fix this?
It doesn't work
and note that catalyst 11.9 is more or less totally broken.  what card do you have?
ATI Radeon X1950 Pro
with that card I would use the free drivers instead
nope. didn't work. got the same error message.
what error message, and where?
"missing asterisk in column 1 at /usr/share/ppd/...the file" and in the center of the screen in a small window.. sorry . have to go.i will try again later. Thanks anyways.
okay.
yes. click on search
have you searched teh name and description for organizer, and stuff like that?. thats the best I can tell you about organizers.... since I am unorganized...

I mean when you are connecting via wlan
i use nm-applet.. do you need specifics about security specs?
what kind of key?
lol. i was trying to change my cursors. then everything disappeared. cept for my wallpaper. and when i restart. it wont load
me not know that much...
so i was thinking maybe i could just restore default icons.  no idea how to restore defaults?
nah... i only know enough to get into trouble... :). bobzero: what are you trying to do?
whaaaa??? isnt it just a higher res. maybe not Blueray or HDDVD
That would make sense to me, and perhaps I've misread, but I recall a few people ranting about how linux can't do HD.
actually its using ntfs-3g :). but yes it is a ntfs filesystem
you can't change ntfs partition permissions I don't think.  it's a mount time parameter
. well, its screwed now. i cant log in, dunno wtf >. hmm, that was my root user
try root....
. there is no user as root :(. i tried
you could always reinstall ubuntu....
man, wtf ... . yea i think thats the only way dude
damn shame.... so there isnt even a root account??
nope
sacabonis: it is your driver then - change the driver. unfotunately i cannot suggest a better driver - I dont know ATI cards that well. I wonder if there is a way to change your Graphics Server
I was thinking is it an obvious problem with the new ATI driver or are we guessing here?
so I cannot confirm it is your driver.  - educate me on the tab keys please?. is it where. then tab
TY, but now I get another error: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Yes. Yes Amarok Eat a large partie from my RAM
yes amarok is quite leaky in that respect
yes I know, but I can't find there now, do you now if it is temporary cleaned :-(
yes, /tmp is not to be saved to, cuz things don't stay there
so I can't recover the file anyway?
afraid not
thanks anyway
perhaps save to your home folder

does me being gay make me less of a man?
: Tks but don't see anything there
sorry, where?
gentoo
quite heavily patched.  you can always add your information/details to the bug report to help get it fixed.  the more info the better
because the files require root. to be accessed
then the problem is with the file permissions

note that will fail if more than one of test is running
yea should only be one
if you want to do it with more than one wrap a loop around it differently like.  for i in $(pidof test) ; do kill $i ; done.  that is probably cleaner :D
yes i do. but not point to new openjdk. directory
did you manually install that openjdk?
using the command line ?
tried the EXAMPLES section of <unconvertable> man tar <unconvertable> ?
No, it's just .mov files (which of course play fine, with the correct packages installed from Synaptic).
Ah, okay. In that case, I'm not sure.
its a terminal theme program
got a link?.  I'll try it, if so
Hmm...  i would try an apt-get update, and sudp apt-get upgrade and try it again
i've doen that..  nothing in upgrade!
err.. the package name is libx264-59 did you try to install that? by itself?. sudo apt-get install libx264-59
yea i installed it manually
my primary host is having 192.168.1.2 guest os is having 192.168.1.22. why i am not able to reach my guest os ?. what needs to be added in virtual servr gateway
Are you SURE the guest has a working network connection? Can the guest ping the host?
ip's are assigned but not able to ping from host to guest or guest to host
Please tell me which VM you are using, also please prefix my nick to your sentence it's hard to see your messages ^_^
Oh, ok, thanks. Sounds like the issue is in vmware then... :-(
grep -i fuse /boot/config-2.6.28-15-generic. or even: grep -i fuse /boot/config-$(uname -r)
Thanks, fuse is enabled I think, says "CONFIG_FUSE_FS=y"
yes, a module would have "....FS=m"
can I say /dev/sdc to do the whole drive as one partition instead of /dev/sdc1?.  I currently have a /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdc2 both of which are NTFS, and both of which I'd like erased.
hm, I'm not sure. Could go the graphical way to be sure; gparted.
I mean I want something like aaa_%string1 from file %.rtf, aaa_%string2 from file%.rtf. Every string has it's own line.  I need to create 4 files for each string
so you need to read a file and create 4 new files comprised of some fixed characters merged with the contents of each line?
yes
I'd suggest you use either a bash script or perl.
a_%string1%.rtf b_%string1%.rtf c_%string1%.rtf d_%string1%.rtf etc.
How many lines in the file?
27 ( 27 strings).  27 * . That'll be like 104 files
It would be faster to do it manually. Writing a script of any kind would take longer if you're not a programmer.
isn't there like a bash command?
Not a single command, no.
I see..
that's a task for a script/program
thanks anyway
np
I tried that, they just started up again.
try to boot in gnome- mode then run gconf-editor. you should be able to edit the panel config in there and either disable the panel or change its position
chlorate: apt-get install ndiswrapper-common. chlorate brb

i just installed smbfs and now everything works
Cool.  I think I had to do that too, come to think of it

sudo mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
sudo mknod /dev/ppp c108 0. mknod: missing operand after `0'. Try `mknod --help' for more information.
there's a space between c and 108
ok i go, my mistake when i put mknof /dev/ppp c 108 0 i got nothing.  any ideas ?
? couldn't you create the device with sudo mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
when i try i got this: mknod: `/dev/ppp': File exists
fine so you created it, restart your pppd and retry to conect
and now i got this error: Couldn't open the /dev/ppp device: Permission denied
paste ls -l /dev/ppp
crw-r--r-- 1 root root 108, 0 Jun 3 03:25 /dev/ppp
and you restarted pptpd?
not yet
then do it and then retry
ok its don i was rebooted server and nothing change, the same error: pppd[1347]: Couldn't open the /dev/ppp device: Permission denied
under which user runs pppd?
Not that I recall.
if it hasn't been identified in over 60 days, you can ask staff to drop it
Ah... it probably hasn't been. What staff do I ask?
join #freenode. There's usually somrone watching in there. *someone
but when i do something on my laptop screen it effects the another screen. for example i watched full screen youtube video
so it mirrors the same thing?
upon: what command?. id?
open up a terminal and type this out. id<enter>
its just a local area network do i have to set up dns then? i dont know but i guess not. [URL] here is the etc/hosts

how do i install a C compiler. ah thanks
most stuff comes from repos, you dont compile much
i did that already it didn't fully remove the settings
It won't remove the settings in your home folder..  Those are in ~/.xchat2. Deleting that folder should do it.
so i should after removing xchat should delete the main folder?
Yes, after you uninstall xchat, delete the .xchat2 folder in your home folder.
ok thanks
!hi|sxx
I have  been a little help but no resolution yet. how do I test if it's stable?
did you check the appdb for compatibility?
It is supported
did you try wine from the wine ppa?
i have wine 1.5.9
"run 'winecfg' go to the audio tab, unclick everything except alsa. on the bottom set sample rate to 48000 , hardware accel to full, and driver emulation is not clicked. now your results may vary but this did it for me and i once again get full sound in all steam programs." source: [URL]
there's nothing to unclick, there's no selected driver and nothing in the drop down menu's in Audio

open source reworking of .NET .. did you try to use a package manager
lets say 30 words - up to 500 characters on average. its a single sentance
You mean like sayings and such... yeah, postgresql or mysql have large string types
an application that I downloaded and installed
how did you install it
./configure ... make ... make install
go to that directory and use make uninstall
oh. I didn't know you could do that. Thanks
no problem, _most_ programs include uninstall targets :).  two things though: 1, if you delete the makefile (or the directory holding it, obviously), you lost that capability; and 2) try using ./configure, make, checkinstall
what does checkinstall do?
checkinstall is a package that uses make install to create a .deb package that registers it in your app list to make uninstalling easy
it seems the xserver doesnt want to start. and i had to use the install video=ofonly option
Cocox: can you help me in the private please
apt-get install imagemagick
you should enable the Universe & Multiverse repos, then try again
well I'm not quite sure how. I have "ri" linked to several things and I only want to remove one of the links, which points to a file that no longer exists
why not just: rm /path/to/the/link ? ( I am tired so I may be missing something obvious :)
i click on whitespace in a site and a popup comes up
any site?
this didn't used to happen on reddit/stackexchange/4chan etc. i've tried adblock but that only works some of the time. and i get popups on chromium and firefox. tried reinstalling too
try clearing your history and browser cache. if it persists, then create a new profile in your browser
tried clearing cache and cookies. will try clearing history too
happens in both browsers?
When I try to install Ubuntu - it won't let me install it dual boot with Windows XP
> I have Windows XP, and I want to install it with it. <> But on the partition screen it doesn't allow me to resize/edit my Windows partition. <> The only option is use it and wipe windows.  reboot into windows, and run a disk check
ok will do
you'll need to reboot windows twice (cleanly!) and then reboot (cleanly!) into the ubuntu installer.  ubuntu's installer won't touch a windows disk by default if it's been marked as not cleanly shut down
im afraid i didnt work. im trying to llok for something in forums
are you sure? I just tried it (in feisty) and it changed the desktop icon size for me. I went to Places -> Home Folder... then Edit -> Preferences, and when I change the "Default zoom level" under the Icon View Defaults, it changes the sizes instantly
new to ubuntu and i'm noticing unstable internet connection. so how do we fix it. ?. i'm new so i don't understand what is that lol
it has nothing to do with Linux/Unix it's your isp
no,this "Try export DISPLAY=:0 ?". well i have another computer which is working fine]
then you need to check your lan driver
>live CD. Don't have that or a CD ROM. I dl'd it all
usb ?
please unmount any logical partitions havuing a number higher than 5. I am using the liveCD to do this so dont understand it
sounds pretty straight forward then
What do i do ?
unmount any logical partition having a number higher than 5 o.o
I dont think there is any mounted and dont know what that meens
alrighty, well in your gparted screen what does it say for the various partitions?
hmm ?
when you have gparted open, it lists your various partitions, what are they?
well the list of my partitions really , /dev/sda8, 5 , 6, 7. but none of them are mounted
youve right clicked them and clicked unmount?
yeah. None of them are able to
unable to? no option or just wont let you?
in 80% of them it wont let me, in about 3 of them theres no option
exit out, run in the terminal sudo gparted
ok . it opens gparted again. and nothing T.T.  Any suggestions?
nothing?
same error message as before when i try to delete
yeah but the unmounting part
yeah:?
does it let you now?
nope
what err msg is it throwing when you try to unmount the ones that have the option, but wont let you?
I cant click the button. it wont let me. and when i check it it tels me its unmounted
what?
At the moment I can't even create a filesystem on the USB drive :(
so it doesn't recognize the usb at all?
It's recognized, but when I try to put a new filesystem on it, it just fails
does it have a device location for it, like /dev/usbsomething
yeah
if you try to copy a file to it using cp, will it work?.  or even just making a file on it. see it that works from the command line
yeah i guess it does.  which is wierd
dunno...maybe it still has some formatting on it...it is possible to hide the iso image on the usb, so try zeroing out everything on the usb disk
using what? Gparted isn't working?
you can use the command line "dd" and use as input /dev/zero, but be very careful of what device you use this on..  make sure you only do it to the usb and not the hard disk otherwise you lose your OS
nope
please open a terminal and run a "sudo apt update" and show the output in a pastebin please
also, i have an exclamation mark inside a triangle in my status bar on the top-right of my screen..when i hover over it , it says update info outdated, connection prob or by a repo that;s no longer available.  on it.  [URL]
see the last lines of that paste. you are using PPAs that are 1) for 14.10 and 2) are off anyway.
so i 'uncheck' them in settings -> 'other software'??
better would be to use "ppapurge" but i think it will bring an error too, because the ppas are off
thanks
kerrian, type uname -r in terminal
ufw status shows the current status. i need to enable it without manual confirmation
odd, mine doesn't ask for confirmation. Are you running it under sudo?
yes sudo.  mine says Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
ah, so does mine. One moment please...
that's the thing, I can't manage to get in :(. I tried F1, F2, F5, F10, F... delete, all keys. it goes straight to windows
esc, f8 ?
I think I did all but I'll try that one again ^^
manufacturers should stop messing around with the boot stuff. i had the same problem with this acer laptop
laptop, dvd drive is kind of slow
intel architecture?
yep
if its a fairly new laptop, no longer than 5 minutes really. i had a 133mhz boot the live cd in 10 minutes. so perhaps you should try a different version of ubuntu maybe go back a version.
Ubuntu 10.04 Beta 2.
You have no use for -d then.  since you're aleady on the development release
Can you elaborate your sentence: "You have no use for -d then" please.
You're already on the development version, so -d does nothing. There is no 'development version' for you to upgrade to.
May I thus reword my question then: When will Update Manager send an automatic notification on my desktop that new updates are available?
What updates are you talking about?.  This has actually become a 10.04 specific question, since I understand it might've changed. You should ask in #ubuntu+1
For example the package aptdaemon. The package version of aptdaemon that I am using at present is not the newest available from the repositories.
#ubuntu+1 for Lucid questions, they'll be able to help you
latrodectus: That didn't work. No USB devices are appearing in Virtualbox
does everything else work in the vm?
yeah..pretty sure. When I plug in my device...it appears in linux..but not in the virtual xp running in Vbox
what kind of device is it?
This is the issue I'm having [URL] Its a brainwave mind machine...just need to access the internal storage to edit some files. Its telling me "No USB Devices Connected"
what is the filesys on the usb?
How can I figure this out?. latrodectus: Its also happening with my gf's phone. Can't access any USB devices on it.. techa: the girl that is locked up in my basement. The woman I sleep with. Pamela. um...sure I guess I can. she said hi
i'd say use gparted to check what kind of filesystem the storage drive is
Well I've got a samsung E720 and an accompanying data cable (direct phone to USB). When I still ran windows, I could get a steering program for that from the samsung website, but there's no such thing for linux.
There may be. What sort of things do you want to do? Copy files over, or syncronise stuff?
I just want to get some pictures off the phone onto my computer
I ran a google on it. There may be software / kernel modules... I'm not sure. It took me a very long while to get my phone syncing.
i know, i cant decide. stability is always nice. fo sho
stable or can you deal with some bugs now and again???
latest kde?. i can....question is if its worth it for the latest and greatest bells and whistles
You can always re-install if things get out of control
yes, should I set it up to mount somewhere else?
use /mnt.  mkdir in /mnt and mount to the dir
I can't find this option in sound options(
or you can try alsamixer in a terminal and start ticking the checkboxes. or unmuting
I tried gnome-alsamixer. When I check auto-mute nothing happens and in console there is "** (gnome-alsamixer:4792): WARNING **: gam_toggle_set_state (). No idea what to do for mixer element "Auto-Mute Mode"!"
try unmuting some of the spdif channels.  [URL]
I have sound from both headphones and speakers now, how unmuting something else can help?. seeems upgrade brought some broken modules and this feature is broken on my setup now. I just can't figure what package does this
it's probably just a setting umuting one of the spdif's or whatever usually re-enables jacksense
well I tried all ticks there and nothing changes anything(
you can try #also or the forums or askubuntu
Can you tell me what package could be upgraded and lead to this? Something with alsa?
most likely
only gstreamer1.0-alsa was updated(
that shouldn't do it any other "sound" packages ?
[URL] it will be very difficult to find :)
I'm not seeing anything looks like just codecs
they are confusing as to what 1st 2nd and 3rd digits are. i know 7 is everything. read write and execute
look up chmod permissions and binary values
ari-yang because i like gnome
login to unity, open up terminal, and uninstall gnome. then restart-oh. did you get it from a ppa?
ari-yang i want both to work. ari-yang yes i believe so
was it a trusted up-to-date ppa?
ari-yang dang i don't remember what ppa i used. ari-yang is there any way to check?
check software sources and see if you can spot it from the list
none yet, just freshly installed

I was trying to remember how to pm over irc but i forgot :(
doesn't screen execute linux commands upon connect if you've configured them in .screenrc?. because i have screen -t top 0 top and when screen starts it starts top in that window
Sure, but if 'cd' isn't an actual binary, it needs to be captured by the shell. What you're used to in terms of 'linux commands' is probably a shell command.
yes.. but I can't find it anywher
what about alt f2 metacity --replace
I tried to rename .gnome2, but it didn't work
I hate to give you advice without you accidently wiping something important out. :\.  Does it say access denied or something?.  You may have to do it from another account.
I've opened the blacklist file in gedit
did you use sudo
did that already. Belkin f5d7010 Ver 7 - says I need ndiswrapper, which I installed following the faq
I can't realy help on this, I was just giving you general info
i was thanking Jaap
okay, fast question, do u have apple devices? :>
does it matter if i use breezy 5.1 and the live cd is 6.06
have you tried using the "recovery" option in grub? that should take you to a root prompt
yeah i'll see if i can thanks i might be back i'm on a knoppix live cd right now lol
well, i'f you're on a live cd you can fix stuff.  all you have to do is just get the system running...then mount your root partition
for some odd reason its not allowing me to read the contents of the hdd
did you mount your root partition?
yes
what kind of issue are you having?
ahh thanks. i had a look couldn't see anything, i'll check again. you mean the Transmission settings?
view -> check tray icon.  sorry
password.
you can reset passwords. via a live cd. or the recovery item at boot time. !password
tried connecting from the shell?
Tried, yes, but I don't really know the commands that well. Got lots of errors, tho. :)
i m sorry, my question how to redo the panel, i delete the panel . ????
right click an existing panel and choose "New panel".  once the new panel is in place, right click it and choose "add to panel", you can add things back to it
_:i dont i dual-boot windows for windows movie maker

it doesn't matter which OS it gets shared to, it's samba

lsusb also hangs :/
hmm. then something is going wrong on the usb bus communication. try looking at dmesg output..  do you have an unusual usb controller in the desktop?.  and check if other usb devices work on the desktop machine

sudo apt-get install from repo [URL]
yes i know . i want it to do by default
ok
okay can you help me do that real quick  ?
sure. Go to applications -> run application and type in "gksudo gedit" to get the editor to run as admin. Then open the file /etc/apt/[URL]st and replace it with that stuff
boot from recovery, run install-grub or similar
i can't boot from recovery, i get the same error
install CD boot ?
well i can get a console root@mycomputer if i press "M" for manual recovery. can i do it from here?
install-grub might help you
it says "command not found"
I mean at all! haha I can't find a 64 bit package and if i --force-architecture it doesnt work
oh right; 64 bit--you could possibly create a chrooted 32 bit environment for that--at least that is what I have heard smarter people suggest
sftp is it then or are you sayin g both are bad. well that
: sftp is fine, it's just another way of talking to ssh
yes i tried that. my pc is a part of a organisation so highly secured\. any other way. how. even on booting for editing it asks for password
then you can't ;p
on selecting the os. any way to unblock usb. hello. lightpriest r u there
yes
I am using nvidia-glx-legacy
right
well, trying to..  but it still doesn't work.
did you do nvidia-glx-config enable? (or equivalent)
yes, I did.
and restarted X
yes.  that's what's messing up
are there any gpg errors, someone had those yesterday
nope
someone was saying security was really slow, how many times have you tried?
bit of both. I have them both set in interfaces atm but i still have network manager installed
network manager can mess things up. but there's also something that can mess things up. have you been adding and removing nics to the system?
how?
gconf-editor, then search for 'nautilus desktop' in keys.  you should find one that says 'show mounted volumes'... just uncheck it.  /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible
thankyou. it worked :)
yep
it's a single c++ file for my irc bot's lua sandbox.  it's a single c++ file for my irc bot's lua sandbox
can you show me the command you're using to compile please?
it's something like "gcc -llua5.1 code.cpp" there was also a flag for pyhread i think it was
and the lua libs are in the current directory?. otherwise i think you have to use -I to specify the directory that lua.h is in
@ I'll check. @ can't find a readme file. I expect it's a variable in the source code. I don't want to experiment too much in terms of trying to edit source code - I'm hoping someone has had this problem and knows exactly what to do ...
is there any file named as INSTALL?
yes, there's an installer.sh file
no that file is a shell script. we are looking for a text file
kuncani: what isgconfd-2 and hald?. kuncani: what is gconfd-2 and hald?
don't know about isgconfd-2, for hald, apt-cache show hal will tell you. (hal is used by gnome to detect hotplug devices like external disks i think)
kuncani: gconfd-2 sorry, i typed in the wrong thing no is in the beggining
gconfd-2 is gnome configuration daemon
no.  only wired.  do you happen to know the solution to this?
well you should be able to go to system>preferences>networkconections go to tab wired select auto

um. would that need any restricted codecs installed?. [URL] i think. :)
i installed all the codecs i could find in the synaptic package manager
[URL] better still :). hmm
i know
Depends on your setup.
I turned it on in windows partition and so on. I tried restarting, stopping, and starting the bluetooth

still no luck... it only lists partners for jaunty even though i am on lucid. i enabled the one for jaunty ran sudo apt-get update and did a apt-cache search for sun and there is no jre or jdk
your software sources dont sound right. If you are using lucid they should be like this. [URL]  Or at least similar

did u tried to reinstall it? sudo apt-get install --reinstall debootstrap
tried that. I see the partition mount point, but thats not what I'm looking for =/
in the lower part of the gpart window the partitions are listed.. the first column should be the device name
wait. Would /dev/sda1 be (hd0,1). or /dev/sda2 (hd0,2)
nope.. sda1 is hd0,0
ooooh. ok
grub starts counting from 0
Ok, I'll try that, thanks..  That didn't work either.
you set it to OSS in the vlc settings? did you restart vlc after?
Yes, I Think I selected the driver.. And yes I restarted :-)
i relally don't know what else, that's all i did to get sound in VLC, is your system sounds on Pulse?
How do I find that out?
system > preferences > sound, that's if you're on Ghome. gnome
For the most part, it all is set to 'Autodetect'
are you on Intrepid? figured Pulse is the default
no. a friend have a preistalled ubuntu with forgotten root-pw , i need to reset the PW to solve the other problems.  dont know there is a rescue-boot in grub menu, if yes i know what to do.
did you try "sudo -i"? Should work if you know the password of the default user
Ill get the computer in 1,5 hours for repair and must know what i have to do.  sudo -i ?.  would that work : sudo -i bash ..... passwd root ?
gives you an interactive root shell. Sudo usually works for the first installed user if you know the password. yes
user-password i know
then this should be the easiest way. usually there isn't
it does not^^

u mean like an ipod??
or just your basic usb flash drive ,
ok
just so you can test that it,s not the usb outlet that is defective
Yes, the laptop HAS a trackpad, but I don't use it.
Maybe if you set to disable the trackpad while you are typing, or disable the trackpad entirely. I believe the trackpad is the source of your error.
i am on sub site...there are 3-4 versions given....which to install ?

which prompt are we talking about here?
when it starts to boot
and what am I trying to achieve by doing that?.  ?
yo
what am i trying achieve here.... at this stage when I boot (I assume because I"m using grub4dos) I get to the grub menu for ubuntu - I have a bunch of options, including boot to restore mode or boot normally. I have already booted to restore mode and tried fixing broken packages to no avail. but I'm not getting to a command line at any point

ok so u have a iso and trying to install ubuntu from that booting the usb ?
Have an iso, have downloaded that to a pendrive using USBinstaller, and then used that pendrive to install to a usb HDD. so the OS is installed on a 1tb usb hdd at the moment. because my bios is crappy, I have to use grub4dos and plop to boot the usb hdd
ok what happens when you boot it ?
which gets me to the ubuntu user login screen (gui). before i get there. i can an error could not call CWAP(1). but it continues to boot. then, I type in my password. i get the welcome sound. but it freezes just after the sound finishes
did you do an md5 on it first?
yah.... this is my 2nd install. it was doing it last time. so i wiped the drive, reformatted and repartitioned, checked the md5 and did a fresh install

would using 64bit perform better anyway? or would you recommend using PAE kernel?
I would recommend the 64bit, it has better performance then the PAE kernel
thanks ... the server is fresh installed, and could connect to it when I was on my local network and could also do it remotely before re-install
sounds like a firewall problem.

OK. and you don't know how to ... what?
Are there any versions where i dont have to actually set up the PC? like companies selling remote access?
i'm sure there are, but thats not really related to ubuntu support
dialup.  I have a Modem directory with a ton of information...but I can;t make heads or tails out of where to start
are you on dialup or adsl or cable ?
@ Im just trying to archive across my servers -- local/main system is out of space
sure, but your command makes no sense.  tar -cpf is 'create', 'preserve' and write to this file
@ very likely -- it was a command I used years ago on debian and I cannot remember the correct syntax; I willhave to play with it some more
tar can write directly to a remote, btw.  `man tar` , search down to 'Device selection and switching'

` ok hold on.  have you looked here ? [URL]
can you try reproduce?
i'm not on KDE, so no. Nor am I on an Ubuntu system at this moment. that does look like a bug, or something's broken, though. i'm not one to debug that though..  remember, not everyone here runs every package (if you're using the KDE version, as a Kubuntu user to confirm). (or file a bug)
usb-creator-kde onnly requires this -> Depends: python2.7, python (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2), python (<< 2.8), usb-creator-common (= 0.2.40ubuntu1), python-kde4, python-qt4-dbus.  i dont see there any kde specific package
python-kde4 <-- that pulls in KDE runtime stuff, and qt4 stuff.
and the same happens in USB-CREATOR-GTK since its the same
if its reproducable in all of them, then you hsould still file a bug about it. that sounds like something is broken in the package, but again i can't test or confirm since i'm not on Ubuntu right now.

established is connected like at the moment you create the rule or whast ?
_: no, a connection is established once the initial handshake is done, has nothing to do with when the iptables rule was run
ok .. i am trying to figure out why you would include this command when setting up iptables . --> $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT <-- , could you explain it please ?
it tracks connection state, allowing a packet that is part of an already established connection
cheers will do. I think it's transfering over the internet and not over the LAN :s
oh, that's a good thing?

see in the devices tab if you have pulse audio or alsa selected.
: autodetect selected , but i think it use alsa
change everything to ALSA then check
: i change all to alsa but , i have that problam yet.  : can you help me ?
I googled a bit for your problem but no specific answers looks like its a bug

I'd suggest uppercase letters for folders and files in lowercase. or all in lowercase :)
have any another way??????
try sudo apt-get install mono-common mono-runtime.  you might also want to include monodevelop with that

try export DISPLAY=:0 && firefox that should work
blkid doesn't return anything for /dev/sda. I want to get Ubuntu to use SWAP. So, whatever I have to do to make that happen.
are you using sudo
Yes
o0.  can you install pastebinit and then run "sudo parted -l | pastebinit" and "sudo blkid | pastebinit" ?
I had to include that when I built vlc
it said it didn't find wx-config in my path so I'll create a symlink somewhere in my path to it.
I think that is the path, not completely sure
i'll check
you should be able to do --with-wx-config=

it's an older vaio, but the previous upgrades I've done have only taken a few hours.
older is relative, what year is it from? Normally an upgrade shouldnt run for more then a few hours. a few days would mean it hangs or is stuck.  may be the bottom of the update-manager you can click something to show the installation console to see what its currently doing/attempting
It's still moving.. Acicula, I've had the console open
let it run then i guess
br10ta10: it should show up in ifconfig
it doesn't. eth1 is listed in iwconfig, but not ifconfig.
br10ta10: is it pcmcia or an internal card?
internal
br10ta10: lspci should give you the type
lspci doesn't list it at all. the only "net" entry is Intel Corporation 82551QM Ethernet Controller
if it is internal then I would expect it to be mini-pci and for lspci to show it
[URL] I don't think I'm missing it, am I?
no it looks like it is just an ethernet card
hmm. it should be there. WindowsXP can see it. Do I need to install a driver before I can even see it in lspci??
no, the driver should load automatically - I was just going to suggest looking for it.  I just found this on the forums - [URL]  you could see if an orinoco driver is loaded - lsmod | grep orinoco.  and try lsmod | grep hermes
yeah, there is something there: hermes 8448 2 orinoco_cs,orinoco

As part of standard install? well will that kernel get upgraded if I just wait?. rather than force users of my project to upgrade the kernel
as part of standard install it stays with oldest Canonical can maintain.  you can switch to using latest Ubuntu kernel with LTS any time though. for example I'm rocking 3.11 on 12.04LTS. :D. (I could be on 3.13 but it's broken for some things)
ah ok,  , so to do that, should I just install the deb like this: [URL]
there's a built-in package for it
lot's of ppl do
so don't waste your precious HDD/SSD space and just use 1GB :P

Okay, open up VLC or is it open already?
open now
Ok, go to settings then preferences.  Then once in there, tick the advanced options, then in the list on the side open up the video part and click on Output modules..  In that dialog which output module is selected in the box that says "Video output module"?
how do i get hte permissions? i used sudo. it worked the first couple of times i backed up
what filesystem is used on the backup disk ?
how do i check that?.  msdos
grep -i samsung /proc/mounts.  well you can not store unix permissions/ownership on a vfat filesystem
/dev/sdd1 /media/SAMSUNG vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,utf8 0 0
you have to use tar to do the backup
tar ?. please elaborate
and vfat has a 4GiB limit on filesize so
tar?
tar cvzpf /media/SAMSUNG/mybackup.tgz /home/sebastian/.  vfat has a 4GiB limit on filesize so maybe not even that would work (if the backupfie is too large)
if i copy and paste that into the terminal it will do a backup of everything on the laptop?
a tar file is like a zip file. but it can store unix permission and ownership
does cvzpf stand for anything ?
no it will backup everythin in /home/sebastian to a file in /media/SAMSUNG/
but it had already worked before...and it copied up to 30 gb
c -> create v -> vervose z -> compressed p -> with permissions f -> filename fllows.  maybe you used other options for rsync
how so? i used the same folders
-avh <<< that -a makes rsync preserve permissions and owner. it can do that on a vfat filesystem. can't*
7.04, feisty.  ...what am I to do with this file?.  I'd be weary of editing it manually
nothing, don't edit it..  just double checking you're on feisty :)
But is it better if it is unchecked?
its ideal to not, bit sometimes the packages can help
sure there is. I've used it but its name is quite forgettable
you mean to edit the gnome menus?
which means what?.  what do I need to do to confirm this?
'grep 120 /etc/group' should return something.
I had one that worked for 2.4 kernel
what was it called?
jap i see the file system to start off is very different
well yeah, windows and linux are horses of a different color for sure
i can put commands in the konsole... but i have no idea how to make scripts and run them,id probably Google it
look up shell scripting.  ^^
yes cat /proc/cpuinfo only shows one cpu
strange
im using the nonrmal shell and i did not modify .bashrc
Your computer's distro and server distro? What are they? Are you using different shell or something like that?
ahh yes
that's one of the core reasons behind the use of UUIDs - make the transition from hda to sda invisible
probobly for sata huh. i see
you can change them if you want of course, for clarity, but the system doesn't care
LJL here goes the reboot
make sure you've got a live CD just in case...
i dont have another computerto test with, really. but, ok, i can manage something. hold on to your butts.
hehe ok. *holding*
yes, but I don't have any problem at installing the [URL]b package... what I'm asking is what is multiverse component. is it a repository like Debian non-free?
I have no idea
- It's already installed, but it's a different version...
what version do you have installed?.  dpkg -l | grep libc6-i386
- 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu9. It wants 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu7
you could force install it, i'd check they are backward compatible
- They probably are, it's ubuntu build versions that differ...
if you are compiling 32bit stuffs i'd set up a chroot situation so you can flip between the 2 archs
I tried install on a different pc but when move to the target pc cannot enter to gui
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
yupp
What version of Ubuntu are you using?
16.04
Unity desktop, or something else?
something else
Which "something else", hmm?
I can try unity really quick though. awesome wm
No...no need to switch desktops...just was wondering....  Since you've got a terminal open, can you type: sudo systemctl restart osspd ----> please?
damn. :(. i don't get any error or warnings
!lstp
it just hangs up every once in awhile. i guess i'll just have to buy another card
yep. thats what it does... others have issues with the cards working at all. I would get ok connection for a while then about every 10 min. it would hang for a min+ then reset. and work for a while more
what card did you get?
really hurt my torrent and ircing.,.  i just grabbed a GB network card from the box-o-parts i had in the basement. :)
yea i know. haha. i just tried 3 old Intel ones. none of them worked. :(
If i had realized that yukon wasent a gb nic to begin with.. i would of replaced it ages ago..  thats odd.. intel shouldbe very well supported
they are like 5-6 years old
shouldent really matter.
im basicly wanting to hack my little brothers computer. but just for fun
stfu and gtfo
Orificium i just need to reinstall it is there anyway to do that from live cd or install it directly from my ubuntu cd?
NM?
I tried ext 3 and ext 4
Mount them read/write?
It says the device is busy
Okay, forcibly unmount it, and mount it read write.
error message " software index is broken "
hmm....  see that: [URL]
thanks for help.  cat | locate glogin.sql. not working for me
or locate glogin.sql | less is much better or even locate glogin.sql >> glogin
ird2k9 even in a shell window?. maybe permisions. ird2k9 try> cd /media/disk. ird2k9 >sudo ls -a. ird2k9 from a shell window
scarlson: with sudo -ls -a via shell window i don't get input/output error...but it doesn't list anything just "." and ".."
ird2k9 try >df. ird2k9 do you see the disk mounted
no disk mounted :( in the list
Thx . Shouldn't the Software Updater do this too (part of the automated upate-process)?
i've found that it only runs an update every n days (depends on hopw you have configured it), and relies on that when you open it. so it doesn't do any unecessary updates.  that's my findings though
I've added a new disk and need to formate and partition it.
do it from the CLI then.  fdisk to partition, mkfs.<fsname> to create the filesystem
well im using icewm
RoundyT1: i have never used an antivirus program before, and never had probs.  then i can't help you, sorry
np
just curious, why do you use that one and not KDE or Gnome?
why dont you use windows :P imho icewm follows a bit more the un*x-idea
in what way?
icewm just does manages my windows, is small, fast and also has a start-button (so i dont gethomesick for windows).
still.. is having a start-button the a unix idea?
</ironic>
:)
will that be out in October?
no idea. In a hurry?
Thanks, I have but I don't mind trying another!
sometimes some mirrors deliver very slowly
just asking....  I may have missed your link... was it one of the 2 that you sent me?
yes
<unconvertable> that folder doesnt exist
you don't extract the skin files either
<unconvertable> that folder does not exist
how did you install audacious
I mean what .deb package contains the program network-admin.
pupeno, I thought that was installed with the installment of the os? if so how would it be relevant?
I am not running ubuntu but kubuntu, which doesn't install network-admin.
oic, ubuntu does
yes but I don't trust it.. it's a stupid Sagem router
does it have data counters and such
and whenever I do that it will go and installl something will failure at end.  [URL] it's 12.04
and you're trying to set up apache today is it?
no php 5.6
but your paste shows it's trying to install the apache module for php5, which is having issues because it can't install apache main...
another server... not that I know of, maybe esd or something like that. And about the apps, just amsn and xchat which sometimes play sounds through "aplay" command
strange, tried restart ? or atleast issuing a sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart. ?
restarting the computer will probably work, I just don't want to. alsa-utils restart doesn't work
doesnt work cos it doesnt fix anything ? or the command is wrong ?
Ok. Thank you..
Win7 or Vista or XP?
Windows 7 Ultimate [32-bit]
Here it is:> [URL]  It is a matter of replacing or fixing the boot.
are you running compiz on your system/
yes
are you running a desktop or a laptop?
old laptop.  and my wife has it on an eee
and you are able to do like the cube and the sphere of windows on that old laptop?.  and is your system response fast and reliable, stable and efficient?
no problems, I think if you can run XP then Linux with Compiz will run nicer and quicker on the same machine
as far as learning source code do you know how and where did you learn?
find something easy and interesting and look at it. If you have the aptitude for it then you'll learn.
sorry, falscher Kanal
:D
I'm trying to set up a mail report wich will give me an report of the RAID setup, even if there is no faults or errors. But I get this error when trying to run the command "mdadm --monitor --scan --test": "Only one autorebuild proccess allowed in scan mode, aborting". and I would like mdadm to send me a mail once a week or so... Varikonniemi: I thought this would be a place to start :)
ok so there is normally already an automatic report on this if you set the mail address in the [URL]nf.  the monitor command must also speficy a meta device
Ikonia: yes, there is, but only if there is an error or failure to one of the disks. And i don't know if the mail will be sent at all... Ikonia: like this? mdadm --monitor --test /mnt/md0
apologies, I'm missing the issue here, why do you want a mail report if there is nothing failed.  I'm assuming you want to background it, rather than run it from an active shell
Ikonia: Because then i know the system is working, the mails get sent and that I will get a mail if there is something wrong :). Ikonia: that's right :)
so for example mdadm --monitor --daemonise --mail=root@localhost --delay=1800 /dev/md2".  madam --monitor is meant to be triggered on failure.  you're probably better monitoring /proc/mdstat with a shell script if you want regular "everything is ok" reports
Ikonia: Ah, that explaines the --monitor option. thank you!. is the daemonise syntax an complete syntax? would it work like you wrote it?
should do yes
Ikonia: I'll try :)
please pay attention to the mail address in the example too
Ikonia: is the --delay option in seconds?
from memory yes. although it maybe ms
ty
no wait,.  do you have synaptic?
yup. yes
there are a different packages , dovecot-imapd or dovecot-pop3d.  install from synaptic then, its easy
its shows me dovcot-common. can i install it ?
that will be installed anyway, install the main package , either dovecot-imapd or pop3d
ok
dont you see those below, scroll down a bit.  also dovecot-postfix for mail
:(.  flash works fine on vist64... when will ubuntu get nswrap or whatever to work with it? i was hoping Hardy would pull this off
no idea ... guess u'll find out soon enough ;-)
using the xpi.  I can't remember how I did it now.. was a while ago
What extension are you trying to install?
i am not yelling...had a brick on my shift key. :)
and have you run the disk check utility on the startup screen
i should updte them no??
[URL]
cool link.  i normally don't have to upgrade my kerenel
sad thing about xchat.. years ago it had a nicer default theme/colors.. and had more features/differnt defaults.. :) its slowly been dumbed down over theyears.  there can be security updates in newer kernels. or fixs to differnt drivers and other things.. do what you want
> Xorg is using 10% of the xpu is that normal?
I don't think so, but I'm a noob too :)
where is supported
On a channel of theirs
hmm. you sure?
About 99% :-)
:/
Give it a try... If it doesn't like it, it'll tell you!
I see the directory where the php files are located but I can not download the files. I'm sending a link a minute
You can only download php files if they are not executed
why
because the server will not give you the php files.  because it is a webserver that executes php files
what yo mean alex?.  what yo mean?
do you see a Shift key next to Z? theres another on the opasite side of that row
yes i know, but does hitting shift fix my monitor problem?. was kinda wondering how shift, could fix that.
it's sleeping during installation cause DKMS (i think) is set to 5-10 minutes depending on graphics card ;)
aah ty . ill go hit shift then.. thx for the help.
no prob, it's not an issue, it's a feature ;)
it keeps failing on and on, ext4 too... dont know why.... so it might be installer related
can you see errors in ctrl+alt+f2 or ctrl+alt+f3 ?. i forgot which virtual console outputs installer stuff
nothing there, no
so what is the actual error you get?
I should go back to partitioning because \ mounting point could not be bound to ext3 file system (free translation from my language) after pressing back, everything in the crypt mapper is messed up and nothing works and I'm left with rebooting or even a hard reset. I got a 200mb efi partition, one ext where i put boot and 2 which I want to crypt to put root and home...
sorry i don't know
ok, thank you so far :-)
do you get any prompt on creating the luks devices?.  do you get any prompt on creating the luks devices?
any prompt? what do you mean?
i followed this guide when i did it: [URL]  the luks device needs to be initialized (and opened) before trying to make an ext3 file system on it.  but i'm just wondering if the installer is showing you these steps anywhere
Alright, thank you.
Have you checked the sound preferences window? Click the speaker icon on gnome-panel, go to preferences.  If your devices doesn't show up there, install this PPA: [URL] and install the version of linux-alsa-driver-modules for your kernel. You can see your kernel version by typing "uname -a" in terminal.
<>: cool.. i might check it out
the zsh man pages explain how it works
k, thx.  are they all installed?
no  they are programs that you can install easily by "sudo apt-get install (package)"
nvidia gtx 560
I dount what I find .. lemme double check .. what returns ' lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga ' ?. doubt*
.  [URL]
I am convinced. see: [URL] . Nvidia recommends the 361 version driver . only available in PPA or in 16.04 .
let me see. i know it's not the cpu scaling thing on full throttle. because cpu is on its slowest frequency
are you familiar with "top"? - you can see what process is using the CPU and system most...
hmm... thanks. most places, exept in xchat eh :)
that would be Alt+X (the line under the "X" is your hint)
ohh.. i see.. i'm used to alt only to get there. well thats neeter though. thnaks eh
F10 seems to work too actually
x86
i can only help on ppc :-/
how long after eol do the repos stay?
good question. I do not know.
[URL]
awesome.
I want to put a icon at the bottom of the screen where the rest of my icons are at.  thanks, i will try that.  i got wmaster0, and wlan0
well, logic dictates that if wmaster0 isn't the one you want, then wlan0 is :)
there is a option somewhere to enable publickey authentification and disable the password one. cause i can login with password but the key is not accepted even thou copied the right way
Yes, that'd be in /etc/ssh/sshd_config...
ahh thanks!
and you can run ssh (the client) with -v (or multiple -v s) for debugging
or the requiremets in a kernel. ok cgz
what do you need to know about it?
that'll burn a dvd iso? where are the options set?
or right click the iso and burn image
Blastedt: jockey - I take it that is the driver software installer for the new 10?
i give up, windows took five minutes to install and ubuntu has taken over five hours and has horrible issues
I know I can wait for that but I am wanting to try it on my gaming computer now but I do not want to use the dreaded 10.10 since Ndiswrapper doesn't make my wireless card work like it used to...
Have you tried using native linux drivers for your wireless card? Do they exit?
it is a belkin F5D8053 v3 which can use a ralink driver (used a ralkink driver on the mac)...
Do you know if Ubuntu worked before with your wireless card, not using ndiswrapper?
yes, but is that a sane default for a laptop?
I had assumed it was auto-detected, but if you say you don't have a parallel port, then I don't know...
nothing in the log :/. wait. think I found it...
you could also do 'ls -lct /dev|grep sd' and see what's on top
should have have done something? :)
hoping it explained ecryptfs.  its in the wiki, anyway the home encryption is on a per user base
ok, thank you
best of luck.. #ubuntu+1|nirvash
THANK YOUUUUU
In Ubuntu, there is a main menu
yeah!. non-rvm. ( i know its bad )
gem uninstall {gem name}. or just apt-get purge rubygems. and remove the /var/lib... whatever dir that has the gems in
enubuntu. enlubuntu
but then, I proposed the name before edubuntu was made
You are good at selecting names
:P
00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)
lsmod | grep snd-hda-intel return anything?
nope.  if i may add, sound worked until today's bootup, regular and restricted modules
sorry, replace the -'s for _'s ...
a.  [URL]
that was a yes/no question ;)
yes i get a response =P sorry lol
lsof /dev/snd/*
yes response? need to see it ?
is there anything except the mixer in there?
nope just the mixer
then there is no reason it wouldn't work.... it is likely a pulseaudio issue, are you running intrepid?
I used a website
umm, you have to be more specific. Did you just visit the website and it magically installed?
it had an installer
continue...
hey thanks is that all i need?
try it and see?
don't like it :)
removeing it does nothinh
I installed it... I should be able to remove it
apt-get remove pacjagename
I did purge
it wont acomplish anything
I know. so.... how do I replace it?
apt-get install packagename
why won't it go away? Saying it's a metapackge doesn't mean anything to me.
saying it wont 'go away' tells us nothing. apt-get remove should remove it
well.. before I installed it, I had a command line.. Now I have a background... with no command line
go to theconsole and you have a command line
And can't access any commands. I'm on the console. all I have is a background
and you see a login: promot or what exactly?
only static when i hook it up and modify xrandr
can you be more specific?
after I tell it to boot in safe mode
why would you boot in safe mode on a live cd
oh, i don't know ubuntu-moto, i will now read about it, thx
motu not moto
how?
which version of ubuntu do you have?
9.04.  i tried searching for the package.. but didnt find any named arts
sounds like a bug. !bug
not finding the package?
yeah, arts is the old kde 3.5 sound server, it's not in jaunty.  and you did install smplayer from jaunty repo?
no .. i had it preinstalled .. and then i upgraded from 8.10 .. and multimedia is all f*&#$d up
oh, then it's not a bug.  you need to reinstall smplayer and its dependencies
so first i remove it?. i did try and install all the codecs and all from a howto for 9.04 .. but that didnt help
but it should have been upgraded automatically... how exactly did you upgrade?
i upgraded through the option it gives when you are updating ..
ok.. what version of smplayer is installed? 'dpkg -l |grep smplayer'
how do i remove and install all its dependencies again?.  0.6.6.  apt-get remove smplayer .. and apt-get install smplayer are only installing smplayer .. not any of the libraries ...
ok, what version of mplayer do you have?. [URL]
sorry for the awkward question. oi..  perhaps lsof.  I'm not sure, but I'll look at those suggestions
there are probably people here who could give a better answer but thats what i use
can you describe your method a little more? do you mind?
well i normally just lsof to list used files then | grep for whatever process im interested in
. Ar first I thought it might be a contact problem, but this laptop is dual boot and it works 100% in windows. Hmm. my laptop DOES have usb2. so maybe thats where the problem is
yeah, maybe some problem with the usb2 driver. trying a newer kernel might help, or might not
Thanks
sure
well, I can see the printer on my machine (16.04), but it looks but it tells me that one of the driver files has insufficient permissions.
ok. how did you install the drivers?
I still get a "cannot open display" error
do you have xserver installed on the remote machine?
: I don`t know. That`s why I`m asking :P
then let me rephrase: try reformatting the swap partition using gparted....
: haha. Nicely said :).  : guess what. The swap partion is locked under gparted :P
some live cds use the swap partition, I think. If so, that may have taken care of the issue....
Didn't make an option in my menu
type in tempest in terminal
So is there anything to be done. - i can't find any options in config edit
if theres no checkbox there for it then no
can i get that with the package manager?
: no , you have to download it on freshmeat
@ thanks!
np
not bug fixes?
if any are necessary, yes
right, but I'm on 12.04
It still may work if it doesn't require too many dependencies. Otherwise you can compile it from source and turn it into a deb package using checkinstall instead of make install.
you mean enable 14.10's PPA on here?. also when compiling, am I going to receive updates when I do apt-get update && apt-get updgrade ?. *after compiling
No, I mean grab the deb package from normal Ubuntu's Utopic repo. If you're getting the latests version, you won't be able to receive updates.
i meant opposite of chmod 755... i want to remove the execute privilege for a simple text file i created in an ntfs partition, but whenever i create a file in the ntfs partition it contains the execute privilages!
default umask for users is 0022, creating files in 644 mode (-rw-r--r--)
so doing chmod 644 for the file would remove the execute?
ah yes, for NTFS partitions it' an other story.
ok so how do i proceed?
you have to specify the permissions for NTFS partitions during mount time (e.g. in /etc/fstab) For more info, see: [URL]
automatic mount? i edited the fstab since i didnt want auto mount...! why is that essential for preventing the file from gaining execute privileges?
permissions on NTFS differ from the way linux works with that. So at mount time, you have to specify attributes like fmask,dmask et cetera
ty, pm? :)
Nah, right here. I think technically we're suppose to give support in channel.
ok :)
Though I have nothign really against PM..  Have you downloaded the latest source you wanted?
it's just easier since the channel is easy.  yea i downloaded it
kcool.  If you've never built something from source, you'll need to "sudo apt-get install build-essentials"
yea i got that :)
Generally it's as simple as running "./configure" then "make" then "sudo make install"
ah cool ty :)
Depending on the output of "./configure" - often you'll need to install a few "SOMETHING-dev" packages
nope lol, gone straight through. ty :D.  and it fixed the bug i had in the amsn in the repos, yay \o/
Yay! I use Pidgin, but I've used aMSN in the past.
Thanks
if you run the ssh server per cast's example be sure you have srtong passwords as you will be scanned.....  It's real no big deal though, just fills up some logs :-)
heh, ok. I don't use ssh so I'm removing i
I altered the port i run it on....  oh... then that will save you like whole 100kb of space hehehe
Bah! I'm paranoid so I removed it. lol.  I'm also a space-freak. I need every available kb of free space. I'm rather obsessive about it =)
I was getting an almost constant scan from Sogang University In Korea untill I changed th port.... (grin) now nothing...
Pluggin the holes in your boat? =)
so you used to defrag everyother day in your windows days?
urgh, i spose.... it'd be nice to be able to login from a windows machine aswell easily though
you can with xming and putty
Well...
)
Thing is, it doesn't respond to eject
bummer.  stick a paper clip inside that little hole on the front.  that'll manually eject it
well im running compiz fusion.... and emerald theme manager
does not matter
thanks, . it seemed like last time i tried that it didnt work.  how about the menus under applications, places, and system?
depending on the theme
yep, with another problem.
repeat i just got back
need to know the WolfET Directory, so I can unzip the maps into the directory..
look in /opt
nothing in my opt folder
thats where it installs here on gentoo, i cant remember on ubuntu sorry, u can use apt-get to look at what it installed
what is the difference between the alternate and server cd?
alternate is the old text-mode installer, server is a specialized "server only" one, that includes a LAMP pre-install, and a few specialized kernels
I've tried that also, but when I plug it into my keyboard it doesn't boot
plug directly into the computer. the usb hub in the keyboard may not be initialized in time to be recognized by the bios
Does it matter which USB slot I plug it into, I have 12. I have one built into my mobo near to the CPU will that effect speed?
It should be in a USB port directly connected to the mainboard. no hubs
Should I try and boot from a Floppy? I have one of those. I don't think the image will fit onto that though
lol
hw do i get it?
they are packages just like any other you have installed
ok, what do i do?
<unconvertable>  First, type about:config into firefox.
alright
<unconvertable>  In the filter, type plugin_expose_full_path or something like that.. <unconvertable>  When you find it, double click it to make it true.
i searched "plugin_expose_full_path" and got nothing
<unconvertable>  k, then just search for fullpath
its set to false
<unconvertable>  double click it to set to true
alright
<unconvertable>  Now, we'll be able to see where the Java Plugin is coming from.
alright
<unconvertable>  Now go to about:plugins.
alright
<unconvertable>  Do you see Java listed?
no, i do not
alright. <unconvertable>  Did you install the Java plugin via Synaptic?
Adept
<unconvertable>  You mean, apt-get or aptitude?
k. brb
I'd start with fsck -n
installed language-pack-gnome-ru ..no results though..
any females here need some help?. lol
yes
have you got ccsm?
whats ccsm sorry I am a noob
compizconfig-settings-manager
yes I used this command to get it sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
type this into a terminal ,.,. sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager. ok. lol. now open it ,. by typing ccsm
ok done
the top plugin general,. click on it
ok
has it opened another window?
I have VLC but it doesn't load the dvd even if I mount it in a different location
vlc>open medium >dev/... doesn't work ?
Correct
belkinhelp2:what ?
i don't know how it's happening, but when i configure lo with ifconfig, pinging 192.168.0.2 (another comp on the network) works, and when i leave it as it was, it doesn't
ip -4 addr show dev eth0
ok i'll try that. what is lo supposed to be?
loopback
Thanks.. [ a-(a*.06)=341,991.44 ] trying to find the answer for a
are you kidding me?
not just the answer but how you acheived it? .. It's a financial formula
a-(a*.06) = 0.94*a = 341,.... so a = 341,... / 0.94
windows partitions
you should defrag them first, but usually.
10 * * * * www-data [command].  ah just saw your message. i'll pastebin the full command... one sec
that page specifies that is only allowed in /etc/crontab.  and that it's not recommended :)
oh really? re-reading...
maybe :) i'm re-reading too.  yeah, `man 5 crontab`.  only /etc/crontab supports it
hu?
wich ubuntu version are you on
15.10
15.10 uses systemd..
so?
where do you want remove upstart then?
from my computer
wich one
yes.
that would be more a irc client thing, unless you meant system wide on ubuntu
I want language settings so that when I enter text, others can see my language font.. If I could use a separate language setting with my font, then I could make that a community thing. That would be alright, though I'm not sure how to easily do that.. So, if I could use Farose language setting with Aurebesh font, that would be alright.
why not start with irc cleints, and check the channel for whichever one that is. cleints. augh
here please look at this. [URL]  sorry, [URL] that is exactly my situation
OK, reading etc
except, it was mispoint grub root/setups that did it. gah
That site requires a login which i'm not inclined to sign up for right now
Does anyone have a solution where vista will boot, ive tried repairing the startup stuff from the install CD.
I think I'm kinda screwed I think...
that always kicks me to console. hmm ill try again
yeah, that shouldn't take you to console
pm
I have pm off
join #idlerpg real quick
Just informing the of the general channel info, be careful want to be led through always is all, no biggie, we do want you to learn.
oh well. sorry for the caps. TJ-: so I am browing the wab. TJ-: I get up, walk through the door everyone do the dinosaur
please wait for responses, this is not a message channel.
I know. I'm leaving this for him to see later. He spent 5 hours fixing my computer. I'm just pranking him. I'll stop wasting his time now lol
stop it.. and the channel is affected
Wow. you have a burr up your ass.
morons galore
not my point,, shouldn't that allow you to recompile with whichever option you need?. without borking the OS?. you would need to disable it first and configure interfaces i believe if youd like to stay online...
i don't want to bork network-manager.
can you point some page out, i searched for this already but there is no from .raw to .avi
it is the same as encoding anything to to anything - a simple way is ffmpeg -i /path/to/file out.avi
oh. LOL. thought that was like not part of it
it's while ... ; do somecommand ; done
thanks, ya its a broadcom. keeps trying to connect and wont. says network disconnected every 3 mins or so
did you install the broadcom sta driver?
ya, through restricted drivers. i mean additional drivers
and you're sure your wifi signal is clean and constant?
yes. i checked other devices.  should i try removing it and reinstalling? everything looks fine
thinking - is it acting up ONLY on that one network? test with other hotspots B4 reinstalling
tried different network, same thing, wireless icon just shows as if its trying to connect
completely update before you reinstall...or try a manual installation. download the STA drivers from broadcom's site.
did a complete update and also did manual install as google suggested, forgot to mention that
grr. ok, then, next thing I'd try would be reinstalling.
reinstalling the os? isnt that a little drastic?
NO NO NO - just the wifi drivers.
just did, checking now :p.  same issue
sorry, then, I can't be of help. stay in channel and ask again...
its like its taking forever to connect forever.  ok thanks. anyone here to help with an odd broadcom issue? ubuntu 12.04 wireless just sits and tries to connect....  could it have been that when i installed the system installed a generic wireless driver of some sort and its conflicting?
certainly possible. actually there's one thing I just thought of. wait one ...
385 and i dont know
do you have anyting fancy installed ? like beryl / compiz ?
no.  brand new installtion
what's your Cpu ?
intel but i had it on here alot and it has never done this
I meant what speed ? pentium 2 700mhz or something
P 2 500 mhz
I wouldn'T expect to much then , you might hve better luck with xubuntu , it is a bit lighter and made for older computers
how did you arrive at that?.  also, i doubt it's 162
Seemed as good a number as any other :D
is that a question?
more an answer
do you speak english?
yes
perhaps this illistrates the problem better: http://paste.pound-[URL]
as i understand from this paste, you want to do a lookup using its own ip (eth0) and that fails, but using the gateway, it works. correct?
:) you have to unload all usb and firewire kernel modules and restart hotplug
sounds quite straightforward. </irony>
Is there any reason why I should use NTFS? It's only a 512MB flash drive
um... its the modern windows standard.. fat32 will work fine .. its personal preference really
Ahhh okay. I was thinking Fat32 in case I need to plug it into a Mac. (NTFS-3G is still technically beta on Mac OS X)
if you used ext3 then you cant use it in windows....  run with fat32 then. its pretty easy to change it anyway =)
no i mean how to copy the file.. i heard i u directly copy from a cd to a pendrive its like copying files it does not boot something
[URL]
so i just add that into the "Modes" line in Xorg?
yes. if you have an nVidia card, be sure the proprietary drivers are properly installed.
thanks. there's no match for restart in that log though
examine '/var/log/syslog.0' then. Syslogs get renamed at regular intervals
max capacity that EXT3 can reasd. read*
single file is 2. TB*. and entire system is 32 TB
Windows XP, under FAT32 file system, has a limit of 2TB (1TB = 1024 GB), and with NTFS, the limit is 256 TB (TB = Terra Byte). but EXT3?
32TB
O.o
xfs is 9 exabytes
what's xfs
xfs is awesome!
its pamming me with Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on displau ":0".
ok.. hmmm
any idea what might be the issue?
perhaps a missing package.  can you open synaptic?
sure.  what do you want me to check in synaptic?
glx.  is there any with mesa
Music player daemon, or exaile =p
for streaming radio......  iv tried shoutcast stuff.. but don't really like some of the stuff
which files?
check that you're in the 'dialout' group, for starters. Markeda, do: grep dislout /etc/group. dialout, i mean
ah, ok. thx. Pelo: I think I've tried that, I'll give it another go
add yourself to the dialout group if you're not already in it, and try again
do you run 2x eth connections?
nope a single eth connection
You filter all traffic over 1 eth connection?
what do you mean by filtering all traffic? I've opened some ports for P2P rest is filtered
firewall box = system between the internets and your lan
yes
Any reason yo udon't use 2nics?
nothing specific for one thing firestarter has a good gui making policies is a wsnap
@ I have installed systemd-services but I don't have any systemctl binary... any idea why?
how did you install it?
it was installed.... then i tried sudo apt-get install systemd-services and it says that is already isntalled
why would you try to reinstall if it was installed?. ^^
will do how do i do that?
ask in #freenode
@k1l when I cannot use resize/move option
look at what i wrote. you need a live system to resize systempartiions.
@k1l it is not a live system
you cant resize the system partitions while running that system. so boot a ubuntu-cd/-dvd/-usb. then you can do that
Thank you
simple websearch dude :)
whats the command ?
are you booting a live cd, then sshing in?
yes mate
it has been a while so I'm sorry if the details are a little flaky, but basicily I used debootstrap. Give me a sec and I might find a howto.  [URL]
ok mate thanks. thankyou
I had to create the partitions myself... mount them, and put an install using that
good because I am running a very old copy of ubuntu and didn. have much drivers
mooch: alot. mooch: what do you think won't work?
well I am afraid to install 8.10
mooch ill pm u
yeah something with capabilities like the Audigy2 ZS is what id want.
your not going to find it intergrated
sudo: no passwd entry for www-date!
ah.. you might have to set it up first...  I'm actually not sure how to do that.
thanks. Its asking em for the passphrase...?
you mean the password.

he can run sudo rfkill unblock all to turn on his wifi
are you using dhcp or do you want to configure it to a static ip ?
its static there
nope, that only shows the bar
stupid gnome, I call a bug
yes there's a changes tab. Comes up blank for all of them.
you can look at the changelogs on [URL]
I don't know, it appears 1-2 days ago.. How I can resolve it ?. cafuego, hi!
what are you trying to do? why are you using grep? you need to start from what it is your attemping
Ive heard bad things about using zero. I can give it a try I guess
i used to use 0 all the time.  ts fine
looking at free -m the cache/buffer usage is whats pushing my memory to nearly full, might explain why its used, but thought buffers would be reduced before swap is used.
stuff gets cached in ram even with no swap.  so it will build up some
yeah, I just thought the system would prioritise and choose to reduce buffer usage to free ram up rather than hit swap. I'll give you method a try.
i dont use swap at all never had problems. if you never hit the 4gb then thees no harm in getting rid of it. set swappiness to 0 see if it helps
mate , you cant mount something that isnt in /dev/ and hda1 or hda2 are simply not there
didn't fdisk -l just show them?
it did, which puzzles me.
maybe it's a udev thing
"ls /dev/ | grep hda" gives me only /dev/hda
sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt doesn't work?
ok , so suppose it is , what am i to do about this? paint my puter blue and toss it into the ocean? lol.  no lol
okay, you didn't say you tried to mount it, just that it's not in /dev. so, let's see...fdisk sees it, /dev dont.  that just doesn't make sense
i agree
well, at least you know you're not crazy :)
notice tho that fdisk -l shows hda1 and hda2 as SFS system
oh, is that what 42 is?. that's really wierd. what the hell is SFS?
how
/join #ubuntu-ir. type that in
where?. in ubuntu server
no, where you're typing right now. /join #ubuntu-ir
/join #ubuntu-ir
no space before it
just curious as to which is the cpu temp
it hugely depends on the quality of the sensors
some say 62 deg and some say 40. which is a big difference
which one. the highest will be core temp. the lower ones mainboard sensors
well thats my point, there about 5 different cpu0 temperatures that it makes the values near pointless
pastebin the output of sensors
[URL]
I would say it is fairly self-explanatory; the cores are both at 65C
thanks. dont see anyone in #hardware
##hardware. Note the double #
didn't notice that, or know there was a difference
w 23
What is the criteria ?
to have enough space to fit ubuntu on
What is the minimimum then
I think 2gig
how much do you use you ?
what does that matter, its what YOU want for YOUR needs
Im using "sudo dd if=[URL]o of=/dev/sdb1"
you need to give dd the disk name, not the partition, like /dev/sdb
hmm. ah ok. not sdb1?
use sudo dd if=iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M && sync
aaaah.  foolish me.  what is sync command and bs=4m for?
bs=4M is the block size of the transfer and sync is so that everything is written for sure
so what bs=4M does?
transfers 4mb of blocks at a time, makes it faster
is this command correct? "sudo mkfs.vfat -n "UBUNTUMATE" -I /dev/sdb"
you don't need to create a filesystem first, the iso has a hybrid filesystem
ext4
stupid quetion, but is there a problem on it to make you want to fsck it ?
Got some processes going into D, rebootet the server, and trying to do a fsck. Might have been some latency to SAN causing the state D
going into D ?
uninterruptible sleep
I'd be very concerned if your san had that much latency fsck was timing out
fsck is not timing out, but seems to be "find / |xargs rm" was the first process going into uninterruptible sleep
how many disks are making up the volume group that the logical volume is in
two
fsck is timing out if it's giving an out of memory error
aha, i see
are they both san based ?
iPod shuffle?
hmm.. i don't know.  again, you should try the #banshee on the gnome server
How do I access gnome server?
depends on your client
Opera 9.5
no idea :)
mine is eth2.  I have not been able to get it working for two days now
For wireless?
I expect that if the vm was installing something or running an application - then it's acceptable... but the vm wasn't even doing anything... :/
do you have an operating system running at least? if not, then i agree, that's weird. but if so, then obviously... you have another operating system running, what do you expect?
well I'd say you can always (as root) tail -f bash history file, . though never tried it
thanks i will look into it
hmmm. have to roll my own then?
no need. generic is fine
I don't know ... I use 10.04, but it can be detect in 10.10 .
lspci | grep -i vga
I did just try reinstalling initramfs, and it updated the generic kernel, but not the RT. same result..  does the fact that I use LILO play into this?
lilo, for why?. GRUB is the de-facto bootloader for Ubuntu these days
there is a bug with my laptop and grub that doesn't detect the optical drive
oh bugger that.  I'm stuck, it's been too long since I last used lilo, .... sorry mate. I meant LILO... RIP lilo
it will be clear the things i dont need?!?
nope, just what I told you, and no more
i dont understand
it removes just the .deb files (no need to worry, they're already installed, so they're safe to remove)
it doesnt show up in xfontsel
/usr/local/share/fonts?.  (or ~/.fonts, perhaps)?
I think I'm running under feisty right now, unless Ubuntu auto-updates.
strange, i've got no idea
correct. cant hit outside dns or ip address, only internal. whoa.... just a sec.. every once in a while it does actually get a response to ping. but it is hit and miss.. when i go back to dhcp it all works perfectly
Does the machine with the static IP have a legit DNS nameserver address in the interface definition?
i did dns in the [URL]nf. the address is legit
I think it's in the iface def though
nope, it's missing those dependeces then. i need that package with ALL dependeces :(
try sudo gdebi *.deb ?
it says it needs dependences.  kk.  looks it's done correctly... let me see... :).  perhaps you know also how to install "libgmime-2.0.so.2" cuz it's necessary.  ? :)
[URL]
thank you
happy2help!
so if i add the file it says im missing will it fix it?. good . you?>
this is my first time here in x-chat
well welcome and have fun
and also im still newe in linux
me to
thank you
I don't think that will make a difference. it has occured in all versions of ubuntu I have used. I'm pretty sure I'm using 10.04. never mind I'm using 10.04. sorry
If magic sysrq doesn't work the next time this happens, then whatever else may be happening there is a serious kernel bug.
How can I find the problem?. it happens to me relatively often. It just occured to so I have log files
So if sysrq magic fails next time run "ubuntu-bug linux" to submit a bug report. Submitting a bug report is a way to get support from the developers of the software itself :)
wow cool, so i just agree, and then i have the latest version?
that's the idea. :)
;-)
;). don't you love these holy wars?
gentlemen! No fighting please! Think of the furniture!
i'm all about VLC, CLI, Opera, BitchX, KDE, Enlightenment, GNU Screen, and Ratpoison
what source am i going to have to get? the whole kernel source?
depends on the module?
.../kernel/drivers/ide/cmd64x.ko ?
and a driver for your hardware is not present in the current version?
Belking USB wireless adapter
do lsusb and pastebin the output
should I just give her an orinoko and call it good?
yes ^^
i have never seen gnome volume manager before. not sure what it usually says, but i must have doen soemthing to the system to change the bootup
u can go to system>prefs>sessions and change it
i used ez-update but it uses ifconfig IP , which is my local IP to update , does ddclient to it as well?
i don't know, i don't use dyndns.
i dont know the answer to that
it's no
nice.
yep
Dell XPS 13 has no CD/DVD drive ;-;
Ah. I'd say try running it again?
iwconfig lists eth1 as the wireless adapter, ieee 802.11b. but. it isnt associated with any networks yet
set up essid for wifi card. iwconfig eth1 essid something
the essid of the access point (along with the keys im guessing)
yes
yes, feisty, but run KDE
Then you don't have the Restricted Manager. Sucks :(
i must be able to access it even though my window manager i KDE, right? through command line
It is *not installed* in Kubuntu. Kubuntu doesn't have it.
no, but it is quite easy to install via adept or synaptic.....if I know the name....
Ah, in that case... "apropos restricted" should give you something in the terminal.
yes, strange it didn't turn up in synaptic...
Do you have the multiverse repository enabled?
I think so but I. but I'm not sure.. how can I check?
See if 'ucbmpeg' installs..  Also, synaptic searches package names and dexcriptions, not actual contents..  .. therea subotu looks for files IN packages
I can find that in the list in synaptic so I assume it will isntall
Yep, should be fine.
errr, global if possible.  What should I do
use the chmod command to change the permission os a file... if you want to make the file readable-writable-executable by the user give the command 'chmod 700 /path/of/the/file'
I know what directory, Just I have no idea what I should use
the 'chmod 700 /opt/lampp/htdocs/wordpress' command will give it global permissions... if you mean this!
Woot! thanks mah fieind
have fun!
well i have an epson 1250 photo and sane finds it but wants to use bt878
bt878 is a tv tuner, do you have one of those too?
yes.  with fm radio as well
so, scanimage -l finds your scanner?
no
well, then sane isn't seeing your scanner :)
scanimage: option requires an argument -- l
huh?
that was to output
what about -L. sorry.
okay
!nvidia
no it does not show as a choice it does list it as a drive found when it first boots and shows the bios screen
does that laptop have a one-time boot menu key, like F10, F11 or F12?
sure  but it is software wich is not in the portage
this isn't gentoo
ehm, in the sources of horay, sorry ;)
then you email whoever made the packages
eh... yeah. but in what sense? If it's just better, why aren't everybody using low-latency kernels?

command does not exist.. command not found, I mean.
try songbird-bin
nope, command not found. it's as if it was never installed
how did you install it? Through a deb or a tarball?
I don't recall. Most likely a deb..  last time I was in my system, I ran an update and the janitor app. could that have done it?
ahh yes. i would stay away from the janitor. until it was matured significantly. has*.  apt-cache show songbird will tell you if it is installed or not
diamoncite, nope. how can i configure grub?
Err.. I can't remember.. lets see if I can find a wiki
ok
After thinking about what another user had said.. try to re-install grub again first, maybe the auto detection will fix ir..  Though for more information.. [URL]
drive_c?
that's your WINE installation's virtual `C' drive.
ok
And you can put things in there as you please.
should i move everything there?
typically, if you install something, it'll end up in there.
it's not an install,
well, in that case, move things into there. ~/.wine/drive_c/yourprogram/. Or similar.
indeed. more of a curiosity than anything else.
It is really just compiz with a plugin that breaks stuff.  Id recommend disabling unity in ccsm and using compiz.  Be warned that disabling unity plugin can cause all ccsm plugins to be disabled
it's my total ram that's being reported wrong.  i'm looking at the right number here
what is your total ram being reported as
you mean to edit tags? theres got to be loads of them out there?
So then what are you looking for. I guess I'm confused.
I want to edit metadata on mostly mp3's and flac's, the id3 tags and such..
the package that didn't make me tear my hair out was just called id3 (I looked)
sounds great, thanks alot
it is command line, though..  don't thank me so fast :P.  seriously, though, i found that it was more straightforward to do what I wanted with the cli tool.
It's not a thinkpad, it was just something I wanted to try. It's actually a business-grade hp. Model "Compaq 2510p".  sorry, forgot to point that at you. :)
does it also have some special (acpi) kernel-modules in use?
Gnome
Are the displays the same size?
they're the same resolution
Does click-and-drag not work?
no, it does if I enable xinerama, but then I get a spanning desktop
I can't move a window if it's full screen.. ...
multi-desktop (yes I haven't heard of it before) is like two different desktops, each one has it's own panel apps and workspaces
So you want the system to treat the two desktops as different workspaces like they would be on a multi-desktop single-display?
yes, that would be great
My guess would be you need a second instance of X running and outputing to the second display. I don't think Gnome has any way to do that but that could be my ignorance..  You might find some answers by looking for info on "multi-seat" linux.
is that a program?
bind is a DNS daemon for Linux. :)
does mac have it?
[URL]  probably
and thats for .. for each client?
- no... its a nameserver that all the other clients can do lookups on
so i need one computer to do this on?
- basically... then in the network configs for the others point to the nameserver on the network. :)
how can I make that work?
unless your driver really supports them you can't do a thing, if you are a programmer you can mess with the code, reverse engineer and create drivers yourself
i'll tell you my problem: i cannot play any 3d game because I don't see the menus, do you know anything about it"
I have read your problem and seems your driver simply doesn't support that. You may need to compile the latest DRM module, but you need to give info about your graphics card
Lattyware: when i run update it fails for some of the repos
change server, try US server
Lattyware: how to try a US server
do you know where repositories options are ?

ok then :).  looky here http://ubuntu-[URL]
how can I install a gui in that @
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg. !server
everytime i login. it says there is a flaw
which is?
-bash: no control. im translating this. but it says -bash. this didnt show up before. "no work control in this session"
please use punctuation instead of the enter key so often
alright. can i reset this session?. what do you sugest ?
are you in a gnome terminal, or the console?
good question. cd32@-desktop:~$. gnome?
you'd know if you were running gnome. It's a graphical desktop env.
no.  i open the file with a player and it says the file is playing but the time marker isn't moving and theres no sound coming out of the headphones
the files are local on your disk or over network?
local disk. local SATA hard drive
hm. maybe the players can not open something like the video or audio device. i usually use vlc. there you can open a "messages" box. i'd check there for error messages
vlc wouldn't play them either
but you could look at the error messages. other players often have such a message window too.
well I use wifi and yes sometimes I lost conection
So, might this be the issue?
but I do not lose conection when I'm downloading.  couldn't it be the driver?
what driver, if working not like;y to just fail during use..  What kind of download and can you just restart it?
yes, i can restart it, but still download crashes, files bigger than 5MB I think, cuz I downloaded a PDF about 400Kb and there was no problem, but google talk plugin (deb package) I couldn't
Can you plug in the ethernet and use it as a compare?
funny :) Failed to fetch [URL] 404 Not Found [IP: 82.211.81.151 80]
there appears to be an error on the repository
Nope, I'm having trouble with my wireless drivers. It really sucks.
what wireless card do you have?
Intel <unconvertable> PRO/Wireless 3945ABG.  Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG, it's missing it's wireless network drivers, and I cant figure out how to install them.
open up your restricted drivers manager?
Yep.
did you install t?hrough there and enable them
It's set to Enabled but Not in use.
can you set it to be in use? :X
not as far as I can tell.. I think what I have to do is switch the ipw to the iwl.. or something like that.. I've made a post about it here: <> or something like that.. [URL] there.. I hate my copy pasta. it always fails
have you tried sudo ifconfig <interface> up?
I'll give it a shot
wait, is there a physical switch for the card?
No.
like, for my card, i have a little side switch to toggle wireless on and off, make sure that's on.  maybe an fn key?.  do you get anything when you type in ifconfig?
I cannot ever connect anything.  Is there a trick to get it working?
it would depend on the system and driver support
my graphic is nvidia geforce 7600gt i installed driver from nvidia but now why quality of most pictures is very low also most of fonts what do i have to do?
Type "!repeat" into this channel
do you install it at first partition. or the whole disk
I'm not 100% sure  I set / to the first partition on the first drive and then /swap as well.. then click finish and it starts installing.
No =/. Wireless.
iwconfig
nope, it was never mounted under media
what mount points do you see in media?
I will. I have to get Lubuntu back on my HDD first lol. I really like Fedora but I have to use Ubuntu for what I do
be aware, for any good maclike doc to run, you must be using compositing

I recommend you join the ubuntu-art mailing list, and go say hi to the people in #ubuntu-art
ok, thank you  I will look for the art mailing list...
mikematic: also make sure you have the metapackage build-essential installed as you will need it to compile any package.  I can get it for you if you want
that might be an issue on the server end
maybe, but my friend's got it working finer. fine*
have you turned off all your firewalls or set up correct port forwarding?
how?.  do you think this thing needs to be pf'd?
not sure what the correct settings are .. first make sure any firewalls are turned off.. i'm not sure what they would be called
I just donno how to turn the firewalls off
thanks

i am on the live cd.  i am on it right nwo using fedora....  do you mean windows live cd?
download and run this [URL]
or the fedora boot up.  it gave me an error, i cannot download.  okay it is downloaded.  now what?
you need to run it. so open a terminal type "cd ~/Downloads" and then "ls" what does it say?
hold on.  it is just waiting.  i did cd ~/Downloads and then ls and it is waiting for a command i guess
are you pressing enter after the commands
yes.  it was 2 commands right?.  it got me into the downloads one
yes. do you know what folder it downloaded to?
not exactly sure
can you open the downloads dialog in firefox and find out
it is in a folder named temp
then "ls /tmp" and see if it is listed there
clean install it is then
that is always the preferred way :) then you can be sure,, if anything is buggy , that it was not cuased by an upgrade glitch
someone i know upgraded and it didn't like his nvidia card. caused him hours of grief
not su rprising
i get as far as 'alsamixer' highlighted but am not sure what to do next

well, if it's nautilus hanging, it may still be a broken mount even if you're not using it
where would that mount be ? how do I remove it ?
oh, ok, well then it's probably not that. don't really know anything about nautilus per se, sorry :/.  well, since df doesn't hang, it's not that. just happened a lot to me, so it was worth a try ;)

to go back to desktop from alt control f1 press alt control f7 or f9.  the reisud thing i told tou is the way to reboot pc if you get stuck
oh i have to rebooti t?
reisub*.  IF tou ever need to reboot it
therei s no way it can just like similar to task manager in windows lol?
if tou need just a task manager.  open gnome-system-monitor
how? i am on the wireless laptop right now.. what do i do so it sees the desktop?
oh.  so, umm... "sees the desktop". :).  I really don't know your network configuration.  and I'm in a bit of a hurry... but basically you'll have to see the machines' ip addresses from some of the ubuntu menus.  and then try the connection between the machines from the other machine by pinging the other one. :).  that is, ping <ip address here>
Haukari_: ok... ahhh.  at least u gave me a start :)
yeah. =) To start file sharing you'll have to start samba and I only know the "complicated" console way, not the ubuntu way. But try to make it work. Gotta go now, bye. :)
no I only see one.  what am I doing wrong?
atlest i thought it was that way....  second, i'll see on some server...
thanks. this is a stock dapper install. do I need to install the SMP kernel?
i was right, here on a 4 proc machine it shows 4cpu's in /proc/cpuinfo
did you install the SMP kernel
indeed you need SMP to use the 2procs
i see. so with a default ubuntu install, is there a file i can edit (through an SSH session) to control the networking config? i'm admining some laptops remotely, an i really don't like using VNC. i'd much rather just SSH, and I'm used to admining boxes which i've built using debian netinstall and built up from there.
sorry no clue, i don't use/like networkmanager, but i doubt theres a file to edit
yeah, i can see why ;) thanks for the info. i'll do some reading on network manager. i wonder if it's possible to just remove it and revert to ifupdown
it is.  even wifi can be configured via ifupdown, just needs a little bit more reading maybe
fortunately, we won't need wifi on these machines. they're acting as "portable" server machines running wireshark and ntop. the client moves them from location to location based on where they are having network congestion issues.
in that case, configuring network should be easy without nm.  there are expample-configs in /usr/share/doc/ifupdown.  just remove networkmanager
aah, xorg had crashed.. I'm back.
ah
looks like something wrong with the partition table, has this computer booted at all since you partitioned the hard drives?
It's my normal work computer. All I did to it recently was remove "quite splash" from the grub file and update-grub2. yes, it ussually boots ;P
dang. I'm totally lost then. I have no way to find out what the locks are caused from. :(.  my bad, it's 4965 not 4565.
have you tried testing your ram?
you don't have the 4965, it's 4565 right? :).  0c:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN [Kedron] Network Connection (rev 61)
guess not then, sorry
im not sure is there a init script that does it on boot?. In the (far distant) past (not on ubuntu) i wrote my own startup script
do you need it on boot? or is after boot ok?
Says I don't have it installed. I just want it in a text file. Like, export what ls shows me to a .txt file
ls > text. > text puts all output into a file named text
Wow, that was easy. Thanks.
NP, but pleasey answer my query :P
What query?
whatever waht chipset do you have exactly?
G33, if you look up Intel GMA on Wikipedia you can read some more. G35 was released not too long ago and G45 is coming soon I think (a while ago since I last read about hardware)
thanx..
isn't that a security problem?
how many groups do you have? are you trying to exclude them?
means that i can then run that deb and no need to compile everytime? thats what im asking
I don't follow you... you need to compile only once, either way. What do you want to do exactly?
backup deb
you want to backup a deb file? Sorry, I'm not too quick today.
no :( ??.  where can i look for it?
- You can specify that the mouse driver use different resolution levels for movement in the [URL]nf file...
thx for the answer but i do not want to do it with conky but just show the free space below the hdd label (made by nautilus itself) if possible
nautilus show free space
next to the icon label on the desktop?.  any idea?
bah using widget, conky, no]
thx anyways, maybe i find a solution, but u know what i want, right (like os x does it)
yer, under the desktop icons.  i'd go for conky still, but that's my personal bais :)
Its not, does it need to be?.  It was working in Windowx without it broadcasting.  Its working on my laptop(this computer) without it broadcasting
, yeah... it suppose to work, but that answer the question why you can't see...
Alright thanks I'll go change it.
, there is a cool app "Wifi-radar"
I don't like to use sudo when I don't know exaclty what will happen
It will generate a .deb package from an .rpm. Nothing else.
the why does it need sudo to do that?
Frankly, I don't know.
exactly ;-)
But its not going to take over your system, or hack you. :p
I just tried fakeroot alien file.rpm and it seems to be working
Thats good then :)
where do the UUIDs come from?
it's part of the label.  blkid
Thanks for the advice, I haven't been able to change the colour succesfully though to avoid the problem. I'm also getting the same problem with the ls command.
what's the issue with ls?
executable files are being shown as black rectangles, so foreground and background color the same.  see [URL]
click Edit > profile preferences to change the color scheme.  byobu opens a terminak, i see no terminal on that printscreen. terminal*
thanks for the pointers
you're welcome.  try --> update-rc.d gdm remove
[URL] I already ran "sudo update-rc.d rc.local enable S"
are the files marked as executable?
yes.  would there be any evidence of them running in the dmesg? I know there is an /etc/rc.d/rc.local that calls /etc/rc.local, does it print out to anywhere?
all you need to do is add the lines, you don't need any update-rc stuffs ;).  are the files readable by all too?
I only ran update-rc because simply adding the lines didn't seem to do anything :/.  yes, the permissions are 755
what are the perms on /etc/rc.local
they're the same. If it helps at all, when I run "sudo /etc/init.d/rc.local start", the script starts normally.
you could have the file add numbers to a file. I'll give a pastebin.  [URL]
[URL] Oh, was that already done?. I apologize if I didn't read up far enough
Nah, that was not already done afaik ;)
how do I chcket it..?
your.vudeo card is what chipset?
should I paste output of lspci ..?
!paste. race conditions can be bad,
well, now that was easy.  thanks

do you use compiz?
Aramanth, atm my laptop is 23c but it was approaching 60c last night and yes I use compiz
I guess you could disable compiz, see if it helps
i've installed into a virtual machine with 512Mb RAM (it's not so much, but i thought it was enough) and my apache sometimes refer me problems allocating memory. i have another VM with fedora 7 256Mb and it works right
512Mb should be ok for a web box imho
i thought so, but i don't know why i'm getting this errors
have you asked in #ubuntu-server too?
maybe will be better, i didn't notice this channel, sorry
no need to apologise ;)
it asks me login
should not ask for it. or use any other imagehoster you can use
oh ok. thanks
use 'apt-cache show packagename' then allows you to read all about the package itself. np
whoa thanks deliere!!
hey np
What video card i have and these.
lspci and sudo lshw
what should be in the credentials file?
Two lines, like this:
or that, how do i that ?
should be sudo apt-get install gnome-shell then logout, choose gnome, login
who's daniel ?
one of the guys who hacks X on ubuntu
is he french or something ?
no. austrilian. *a
ok
it wasn't listed at first but i found it and made it listed in the menu
ok
applications-add/remove then go to internet and you should see bit torrent listed first
ok  , i see it, bur i cant link on my Desktop :/
ok then its a matter of making it listed in your menu and i forget how i did that as well. one more sec
no icant, not anymore. i get to system is detecting hardware and then black screen.  tried with win2000 and got to starting windows 2000 and then it just hangs
oh.. thats a bit tricky.  tried with winxp cd?
yes.  i have remnants of grub on here
you could install say debian and it might detect the windows and create a loader for the windows
I have two identical drives (cloned one onto the other with dd) so I think it's having difficulty differentiating them.
because /dev/sd* names are not reliable between kernel upgrades etc
Thanks; unfortunately the UUIDs were copied to a second disk when I cloned with dd, so they appear not to be unique.
labels ftw.  or PARTUUID/LABEL if you use gpt
Thanks; I don't know anything about that but I'll google around.

avenger::yeah i can be sudo
not if you can, if you ARE while trying to open the drive
how would I go about doing that?

I can't find it
it's in the properties. err. try right clicking on it :). doesn't somebody here have banning power?
What do you mean by "just search"?
well, in most apps you can search inside a file for stuff.  just open the file in a texteditor that can, if this is a textfile which I assume
Excellent! I am speaking about a program and not a file.
okay, then what program? or is the program called ".config".  or am I tlaking to the wrong person here? (goes checking)
The program's name is '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration'. I have clearly stated that in my question at the outset.
hehe, you don't expect me to know the name of every program ever written, do you? To me that seems like the .config file for a kernel. Anyhows, good luck ;)
iwconfig lists eth1 as the wireless adapter, ieee 802.11b. but. it isnt associated with any networks yet
set up essid for wifi card. iwconfig eth1 essid something
the essid of the access point (along with the keys im guessing)
yes
see. i tried that, and it throws a "SET failed on device eth1; Operation not permitted". which strikes me as a bit odd
dunno. i don't have that problems
yeah. one of those
yes, i do then :D.  well, my wifes pc does
YES 404
ok.. the problem isn't you.. .it's the website... i'm not sure why you think it's an ubuntu issue.
I cannot connect to wifi properly in university
are you low on battery ?
I'm not in low battery, it happens everytime. I followed this [URL]
do you have a /etc/modprobe.d/[URL]nf file ?
I do
try adding this in that file : options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 then - sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi and sudo modprobe iwlwifi
hmm, that's not good in my case. I would like a script to execute when the network is available, but before the services are started (apache, supervisor, etc, ...).  when/where should I run my script then? :)
You would have to create an upstart-'service' that runs the script... I guess...
ok, I'll look it up :) thanks.  by the way it doesn't need to run forever, it's only an update/install script for a mercurial repo
eviddent, but it has to be started @ an exact time, as you mention. You just have to tell upstart 'when exactly'...
sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubunturoot -o umask=000.  does that not work?
Arrenlex: I got a error : mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1,
are you sure /dev/hda1 is an ext3 partition, then? Are you trying with the -t key or without it?
Arrenlex: I am using it I mount and unmounted it with this : sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubunturoot
the issue with NFS is that on the remote machine a user has the name of mikedoug (UID 1004) and on local (his machine) has UID 1001 or 1000, username mike
not a huge issue, you can do mapping.
ok, what if it isn't?
visiting the ubuntu forums? and the wiki. or google
dont ask me.
sorry, wasn't asking, was telling
uh ok
cat /var/log/kern.log | grep -i panic
haha, yeah.  thats the "newer, simpler" documentation ;)
OMH. s/H/G/
I tried adding the options snd-hda-intel model=laptop-micsense which i have seen others with the same laptop have success with yet it didnt work
<unconvertable>  sorry, don't know what else to suggest.
Inside the BusyBox shell?.  Er, what do you mean?
other than that you can reinstall the ubuntu-desktop.
currently in a shell, so n.. er, no.
I changed my window manager in gnome from Metacity to openbox, here's a link I followed.. it may help you: [URL]
ok. ty. still the same . do i restart?
shouldn't have to restart. do this: df -H
how i do that?
open a terminal and run that command
ok. sudo df- h?
no
yup
on the desktop
i changed it to 7. is that not the same thing ?.  or how can i set an overall default log level ?
use names instead of numbers -- i am not sure numbers are valid .. or i've never seen them used this way.  for this script .. you can use a global variable
ok that made no difference?
let's see the script now
Ha! thanks  worked like a charm!
I'm still a fan of FB MPlayer.. That's why I've been avoiding it...
how ? *sigh*
I think mouse won't move because I switched other one with new one and I did reconfigure xorg but still not working right even tried Option "hwcursor" "on" and few other things.  I've had the no icons/panel shit happen before with xfce on xubuntu too its an annoying bug with that window manager or something
default is about 40M
And why is that critical to you then? The initrd size is determined by all the modules you activated for being compiled.
stock nvidia on Dell Demension 8300 and through ubuntu update manager.
"apt-cache policy nvidia-current" does it show installed?
wat
!PPP.  how are you connected to the internet?
No. Can you easily download Windows images for it?
download windows images? you need to own the iso and mount it in virtualbox to install it
: yes sir
so you want the cursor to never be at the bottom of the window, essentially?.  I'm not sure how to do that. I think it'd require a plugin, and I don't know of any one (but my knowledge is incomplete, and I'm not >95% sure)
the panel does not exts.  the panel does not extist .. its is a small one ..
I'm not entirely sure what I'm talking about, but i thought the entire bottom bar is a panel...i assume you want to add the virtual desktop switcher back in right
ah ha. And I'd do "lsmod | grep "DEVICE" for the device I'm trying to troubleshoot, like "Keyboard" or "Touchpad" . . . yes?
mmm. well its not that clear. coz the usally have wierd name. like usb_hid or somthing. i think there is a list of the module.o files in lib
there isn't gtk+ over there..
It's probably not CALLED gtk+. You probably want gtk2 or something like that. Although I'm pretty sure on a standard install gtk in installed by default.
is there a tool in ubuntu for that?
when live cd put in pc then first menu will have that option
k, so reboot machine, boot off cd and use ubuntu to check for error's. if I find an error on the cd should I try and burn another copy?
no put live cd start computer. live cd will show options like try live cd and install and third option is check cd for errors
what does that mean...is it just the networks that the data goes accross
it means don't use ftp
on [URL]
They tell you to use that program and not how to get or install it.. got a link to it.. !ask
tyro my question is how much bandwidth is eating up?. im trying to connect to my dedicated server. which has the server on it
are you in orlando?
i want to know how much bandwidth its going to eat up @ 1024 x 768 res. no
just run "top" in a console and see what X is taking up
Thankyou. Astro: Just in case, how about COM1
/dev/ttyS0
: ok what are those other flags for? lba or lvm??? thx for reply by the way
lba is what you want
, lba for swap?
no don't get confused just click next
ahhh its a bug then
There's a workaround in the comments that might help ypu. "you", rather
not working. I really need openssl 0.9.8. on ubuntu 12.04
what is the output of: apt-cache search openssl. ?
[URL]
line 20: openssl - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools
yes but thats version 1.x. I need 0.9.8
in such case you should create your own packages for 0.9.8
wut -_-
do you afraid that openssl 1.x has some security wholes (compare to 0.9.8) ?
installed, its suddenly stopped booting at an early stage. "starting apparmor profile" etc.  first it stopped upon "Loading cpufreq modules" which I deactivated, this didnt help, so I assume its the step after that
edit the boot options in grub with e to edit the boot to not show the boot splash so you can see whats going on
I would really just like to know how to troubleshoot it...  It does turn off splash at the end, showing where its failed... you mean quiet=no
then websearch for that, see if there are bugs or guides for it

u mean synaptic package manger??
thats one tool that can do it.. or the command line tools can.. or if you are using kde, adept can do it..
im using gnome ima see brb.  i have p7zip-full in synaptic package manager working
fire up synaptic, search for the package, check its properties. it should show what files it isntalled.. the commands would be the ones installed to the bin dirs.. !info ungoodmerge
/etc/bash_completion/git. i deleted it after overwriting it with the version from git upstream (which hadn't worked, so i removed it, that it will get reinstalled the next time.  any ideas?
no, sorry, its out of my league
thingymebob nvidia
My old Nvidia works OK so I would expect this to be ok too, What exactly do you mean by poor.
its somewhat slow and not very smooth. I also trying to run it in 1920x1080...

links no good for me
what version is your driver?
180
have you tried 173?
ill need to try that i suppose
jahc: install localepurge to get rid of all languages you don't need. jahc: sudo apt-get clean
are you experiencing frequent crashing?.  be patient haha
did you try start from terminal to see errors
i did not, but thats a great idea
is it random crash, or just when playing video's?
it said the interface was busy when i tried to switch back
or u should work with virtual devices.  maybe u r still using it... is there another program running which makes use of the device?
shouldn't be, i ran ifdown wlan0 before doing it
anyway, gotta go... cant find help here. :( good luck with your problem! (try to unload the module and relaod it, everything should be back to normal)
if it's *that* serious, just recompile it?
I tried, I have no idea how. Isn't this supposed to be linux for human beings? Just saying..  we can continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic, if you'd like :)
no thx, I'm just saying, you should just recompile your game if it's that serious
want to help me? It's not as easy as it looks. I'd have to recompile the whole gnome-games, because the gnibbles package doesn't have its own makefile, etc. not to mention I am on a netbook, so the time involved in doing that would be crazy
nah, it's been 3+ years since I compiled gnome, wouldn't be of so much help
okay then. I've grown rather attached to the gnome-games over the years, lol
. thanks. any idea of how i can test throughput?
you could use netcat.
thanx  :)
that's not an ubuntu thing - thats an every linux distribution thing :)
What is a mounted drive?. I see the mount/unmount options
mounted partition is an accessible one, unmounted partitions are not accessible
So, in actuality, if i didn't mind removing the driver before updating the kernal in the future, i may see better performance or less bugs by downloading the official nvidia drivers?
probably not. You can give it a try if you want though. You also don't have to remove anything, just (at worst) reinstall the driver in a non-X environment everytime your kernel gets upgraded or (at best) dkms takes care of that for you.  but that way you also have to handle upgrading it all the time
- will Transmageddon work?
I have no idea what that application is
never mind  , im using mencoder.  ,can I PM you?
is it about mencoder ?
nope
ok.
- mencoder works , thanks!
no problem.  out of interest, what options did you use with mencoder ?.  eg: what converion parameters did you use
yes, but all messages are in portuguese. Is there any way to made it display them in english?.  here it is: [URL]
setting LANG=C or LANG=en befor apt like this: export LANG=C; sudo apt-get whatevercommand
I do have some liveCD's. Any ideas that don't require rebooting?.  or what would you recommend using the LiveCD
durep is a handy program, it will show where the space is being used.  if you use knoppix i believe there is a disk used utility built in
I used the janitor tool and I think if messed everything up :(.  ATI Radeon 4850 HD
i find that janotor tool to be the kind of thing that should of not been included.  it most likely removed your fglrx drivers - you could rerun the 'hardware drivers' tool and it may want to reinstall them
ya I know I thought it was gonna get rid of unused packages but boy was I wrong
it removes unofficial packages I think. :) ive never really messed withit once i saw what it was wanting to remove
i did
and doesn't work?.  doesn't work?
nope it cant find the package
you have to install manualy. and will work
i know about that. However i have two disks and i need to figure out where my windows partition is for GRUB.
sudo fdisk -l
that returns info in hdb2.  It does not return where the NTFS partition is.
fdisk -l should list every partition on all fixed drives; one of them should be marked as ntfs or vfat on the right
i started up GParted. That says its hdb1
then it would be hd(1,0)
so i take it its (hd1,0)
erm,  :)
yeah... That's what it says in my GRUB startup. But it just displays a bunch of random characters..  The whole problem may have been that i had the ( right before the hd instead of next to the 1.
no, you wer right, that's what the erm was ;)
well shit. That means it doesn't work right.
does your grub stanza look similar to http://paste.ubuntu-[URL] ?
all but the save default
with all this grub garbage going on, it makes me reconsider going back to lilo
well if i could make it work. I would..  I almost have it running. It just displays a bunch of random non-latin characters when i try to make it work..  It lets me go to the menu and choose windows as an option.
I've no clue about that, really. My fear is that there's something wrong with the windows boot, especially if all else works, you're using what sudo fdisk -l says is the right partition, etc.
how is that supposed to be helpful?
Because about halfway down it tells you exactly what you're looking for.
I've already that package installed on my sys
!info openssl*.  [ sudo apt-cache search openssl*. ]
apt finds so many packages... :(
you can scroll terminal windows...
sonne: and then if i want a user to connect to my ubuntu ssh how to do that
create the user, give it a password, give your ip to your user
how is it to add user is it sudo add user
sudo adduser <username>
DNS 343 is a Dlink 4 bay nas, with Fonz Fun Plug installed... linux yes, ubuntu no... their channel has no one active for help, and the forum is SLOW....  so you think the command used to initialize Transmission might have bad input (map?)
did you try googling evmap.c:401'? if someone else has seen this issue they would have used that as part of their search terms'

pic2fig?
installation
just the normal ubuntu installation?
it was just uninstalled. but i don't know what it does :]
nothing, by itself. that is, you can remove ubuntu-desktop without affecting anything else. but put it back before you do a command line upgrade please.
okey! tks! :)
i think the automated upgrader deals with it for you so that you don't have to..  the upgrader that opens when you click upgrade in the update manager
ok. thanks!!!
see you there alex. so...
hmm , so I guess either I have to fix my X in edgy or do a clean install ?
basically yes.  what is your problem with X
I used wiki guide to upgrade from dapper to edgy (basically using "update-manager -c"). now all my windows open up at the top left corner, I cant move the windows or minimize.  actually I dont even see the bar for those minimize/close buttons
seems metacity is bugging.  can you move the windows while pressing the <alt> button
enter empathy and press F4, add a new account, on the right panel you'll find a drop-down menu with IRC option in it
k following
cifs share
there are options that you can append to the mount command. e.g. -o umask=777, or uid=gid=ArtGroup
i've read that you can corrupt it if you don't shutdown properly?
no Ive had this system up now for two years at least half a dozen brown out and kernel panics and I havent lost a file yet
hmm maybe i should try xfs out :)
Ive got a mail server at work running exim on raid5 with xfs never had a problem and thats not on a UPS either (the ups blew up and the company is on a tight IT budget)
can you look in your scroll back and see who told me how to use make a deb ?
he's not here anymore, it was bur[n] er
can you paste waht he said again ?
what are you trying to do?
i just need the argument for make install and the dpkg command to build a deb
that doesn't make sense, what are you trying to build?
from source....
yes, but what
exact same
would it make a difference if you put the --raid-devices section before --create?
i dont think so i'm copying this command from a guide.
one sec, I'll look into it
Its already installed the leatest one,  . By the way, I like you country.. If so..
have you restarted your browser ?. and perhaps tried in a different browser?
Thank you so much, have been trying to fix that for ages!
np.  i'd reboot just to make sure its ok
hm, even after putting the right arguments in the menu shortcut, and re-starting gnome-do, it still seems to just launch "chrome"
really? hmm
oh. that'd be a screen recorder then
i am looking for a way to do it via a script, as to run in a server. i am looking for a simple easy to hack with terminal video recorder tool
nothing! i meant chroot!. to update the grub
oh ok
i'm fairly new at this stuff.
thats fine :) you just scared me
does it dial out and establish the connection?
no.  to actually dial out "sudo pon". I believe "slightly more friendly dialup tools" are on the todo list somewhere
okay, thanks. that helps me out.
I asked about it just before the public preview
thanks. I already tried searching in forums but got nothing. Well my best solution would be, re-installing 14.04 through live-usb. However, my problem is how to re-install 14.04 without affecting my files and applications. Any idea?
did you make a separate home partition on your harddrive when installing 14.04?
i run sudo apt-get upgrade and recive You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these. and give me E: Couldn't configure pre-depend upstart-job for hostname, probably a dependency cycle.

Things have changed... but I really can't seem to answer you question at the moment.. does it work on another box?
yep, with another problem.
repeat i just got back
need to know the WolfET Directory, so I can unzip the maps into the directory..
look in /opt
nothing in my opt folder
thats where it installs here on gentoo, i cant remember on ubuntu sorry, u can use apt-get to look at what it installed
how do I check with apt-get ?
apt-get --help
meh.. didn't help meuch...  much*
man apt-get
bah.. I just need to find sombody that knows it.. make it easier on me..
theres a way to search, but look in /usr/games
already looked there, when I g to laucnh it, it's in "apps/other". anybody know where the wolfet directory is?
what do u type to run it?
'et'
sudo find / -name "et".  tell me what that says
nothing yet, just entered to the next line and it is sittin' there
it's searching
When i start the app, it dosn't draw the globe properly. It's a little better with 4.2. What can it be?
What graphic card do you have.  ?
How can i see that, isn't there an easy way in ubuntu? I dosn't normally use ubuntu
hmm let me see
I'm just helping a friend
lspci | grep vga.  sorry it's lspci | grep VGA
lot means?
much
thats so 'windows' but i'll try
hehe yeah, but that happneed to me once and it went away on reboot
its x86 64. its 64 bit i guess?
sounds good
i have ati.
i'm guessing you could still do it though i'm not sure that is the solution. you can dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from a terminal.. add a sudo in there and you'll be fine. fear more beer !. sorry.
Pidgin has no voice chat. I have Pidgin
I dont use IM clients much. and i definatly dont bother with voice chat in them. :) you may want to check teh forums.
didnt worked
i was asking but this is how you do it: pulseaudio -k and then pulseaudio -D
im still pretty new to ubuntu do i get that through terminal or can i use the add and remove apps bit?
you can use synaptic to install vnstat. The last time I used vnstat I had to use the terminal to configure it
when i switch from battery to ac or ac to battery gnome or what ever the power manager is, does not recognize that switch...
ohh
but I want KDE-apps only in KDE, and gnome-apps only in gnome.  yes, but the menu gets messy as heck
i cant remember what i did
by d way happy valentines to all
do you have a support issue we can help with?
is it easy? is there a guide or any advice you can give before I give it a shot?
depends on you graphics card.. google around for howtos.  nvidia cards are quite easy to setup
well Ive got one nvidia and one ati or intel/generic. Ive got a couple of spare ones. both are really old though, compared to my nvidia one
should work. I have nvidia (with dual outputs) and matrox
np. I just don't use it. I got annoyed after following the instructions and still encountering problems, so I gave up.
Yeah, it was a pain in the arse.
pretty much. It was really discouraging given I followed the wiki instructs and it still didn't work.
Wireless still has a way to go in and distro of Linux.. IMHO.. s/and/any/
yeah, I don't find as slick of implementations, in particular with wpa.  that was just a really annoying issue to me....
I share your pain.
I'll try that . Thanks for the answer!
what was the dpkg flag for ignoring a .deb arch type
dr_willis I'm thinking there is something wrong with the disk maybe... sometimes when I reboot it still doesn't see it
ive found that hard drives are the 'weakest' link. these days
dr_willis ocz vertex, I had just flashed it to 1.6, the flash disk sees it every time... but live cds are having a hard time
watch dmesg out put for various messages about it. you could 'zero' the drive with dd, as an extreme way to try to hammer it into submission..  its one of those new 'sdd' type disks?
dr_willis decided to flash the disk, then afterwards (everything seemed fine) upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04... that's where I went wrong, upgrades hate me
or what do youy mean by 'flash the disk' ?
dr_willis yeah, it's a ssd... but I've had NO problems with it for almost a year. dr_willis firmware upgrade
ive never even seen a SDD. so cant help then. Could be some bug. I need space. not speed. :)
dr_willis the 4TB lvm/raid array is for storage :P
ive found in the past.. i do better if i keep things simple. :) no more raids for me. or other fancy things..  i got 5+TB in slow external usb hd's :)
dr_willis it's got to be the drive... this time bios isn't seeing it
ouch. Thats big $$ also isent it.
Just want to setup 2 shares one for music and one for films for our home network - but with user authentification (so i can write changes to the share but others cant!)
have you added users to samba?
sure have - they just point me to a Wiki where i get highly confused, bang my fist on the table a few times and throw the computer out the window in frstration
lol thats ok
ive set the shares up and can access them fine - but cant write to them. Once i change the authentification mode - i get all sorts of problems :(
you can easily assign shares via the gui as well
Theres a GUI!? (ive been using webmin!!)
actually the gui just allows normal sharing access to the folders
N00b Question here - but will that still work for windows clients?? (with authentification)
the webmin is more precise but if you want to just have users to just have normal read access.  yup they just have to type the username and password (you will need to create another user on your box, though)
Awesome - is the gui pre-installed or a seperate install requirement?
all i've done is typed, samba in the synaptic package installer and installed samba
Ok - which i have done - wheres the client to configure it?
basically what you need to do is create a user give him read only access and then add the user to samba, with the same username and your own password or no password and thats all. When the windows clients try to access the shares they will use the user account with the read only access simple and sweet.  theres no client as such, all you need to do is right click on a file allow it for sharing
how do i set that?.  thanks
check out your keyboard layout, and make sure it's mac
can you point me to the how-to? The [URL] only mentions off of the CD
[URL]
<unconvertable> all the displays are scaled 1x1.  <unconvertable> and if i try to scale the lower res displays to 2x2 they all stack on top of each other
yeah, it's a pain, to muck with dpi :)
ASUS
are you running a custom firmware on it or the stock?
the stock
you'd have to read the docs to see if you can do that. Alternatively you may be able to install dd-wrt or tomato firmware on the router, but you would need to see if your router model is supported
the router docs?.  what is telnet server for?
to log in to the system and issue commands, what are you trying to do?
PraiseChaos, exactly.  I want to trigger a log in remotely
look into synergy perhaps
synergy doesnt work before login
it does if you set it up to :)
How did you fix it?
its a common problem, and there are a few fixes (non of which i recall). however, just google it and see what you find.  at what point i got it to work but it was jerky. im afraid i cant remember exactly what i did to fix it, but im an ubuntu noob and i googled and managed a fix
not yet.. any acpi guru here?
you might like it (better)
really? i'll check.. :)
otherwise enable muliterse and sudo apt-get install acroread. mulitverse*. geez I am in typo heaven
A6-3420M. (Radeon 6520G). Installed fglrx successfully, but now this is happening.. Installed Catalyst 10.10 manually from AMD's website.
!ati
I followed this guide: [URL] or rather their Quantal guide
did you run: sudo aticonfig --initial
yes.
if you press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in there, then restart the lightdm service
that returned me to tty7 (login screen), wherein the problem persists
try: killall -u $USER
I ran that command in tty2, but still can't login in tty7.
I suggest you run: less /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see what is going on
I need nice X player with GUI
have you tried xmms or a clone like audacious ?
ohh ok. actually the 38 kernel didn't install.
did u select it.  try the 38.  if it works. then go ahead and after u are running it and hit apply updates and should install those files. .  think the reason is because u manually picked and running the 36 now
sorry. had to refresh the page..  I dont have the kernel 38 installed. Id didn't install.
sorry u d/l it but did not install ???
OK, I'm now installing the 38...
ok.  then boot in to it see if it works if it does then do an update when u are in the new kernel then it should install tose 3 files.  apply
wow, weirdest thing. It works and didn't even have to rebuild nVidia drivers (been having the drivers not work upon every kernel update). It seems that something processed half way and it got stuck in the middle... It seems to be working now. YAY!!!!.  yes, everything is working again. Even WiFi.Thank you very much!
ok now see if those other update far u. those update the kernel and boot u into the newest one.  n/p
actually I had to explicitly state that I wanted to apt-get install linux-generic linux-header-generic linux-image-generic
did it do that???
nope.. the option is grayed out
wow - I didn't think evince honoured that!
me either
never used it, but apparently there is a pdfcrack program to get the password to allow you to print it?
in the repos?
actually, no idea ;). I just googled it
where? i see nothing about verticlesync or refresh rate or anything
you need to add the Option
how?. ergh. what do i add?
in the 'Monitor' section, just add: HorizSync xx-yy and VertRefresh xx-yyy
what are xx and yy? 85 and 85?
i.e.: VertSync 60. or VertSync 60-85. if you use '-' you can set up a range
okay, thanks
!vfat
hi im iinstalling epsxe (1.60) and i cant run it...
what does it do when you try
ok lemme try that
command1 && command2 means do command2 if and only if command1 exits successfully
I think it's already installed...
build-essential should pull in binutils, can you verify both of those are installed?
ah-hah!. gconf
Yeah, they must have removed it from the prefs. (?)
i have backports enabled and i couldn't find it.
Then it probably isn't available.
yeah but is there a way to still get it using apt-get. like to force it to download and install
Like hand editing configuration files?
they are both eric 3.x.  one eric 3.7 and the other eric 3.4
then just different compiler packages ... both are probably suitable, get the 3.7
oook.  do u use it ?
no
yes very interesting but it doesnt solve my problem, if you dont want to help me, ok
/dev/sda7 /media/ntfs ntfs rw,auto,umask=0,noatime 0 0
thanks :)
note that /media/ntfs has to be mkdir'ed first!
into the terminal window? yes
I mean here, so we can compare
thanks  a pity
i think it has more to do with the way the developer(s) laid out the dialog.  maybe adjusting the font size(down) may help
: thats why i'm asking
it is a waste of time and will provide false results, don't go looking for rootkits unless you have reason to believe there is a problem
: ok , i will but please explain this mail confgiguration to me
you don't need the mail configuration if you are not using rkhunter.  so you don't need to worry about it
: please ,i'm begging you
press cancel so the package doesn't install, that's what you need
: i want to know what are they for
they are for different types of mail server setups, you are running non of them, so don't need to worry
: what is smarthost ?
a mail config you are not running
: please ! i'm going to cry now
then I suggest you start crying. Look this channel is for ubuntu help - not "please tell me random linux things because I don't want to research".  people have tried to guide you but you just ignore it and carry on, I suggest you look at more generic linux channels such as "##linux"
I still like to have gdm to login with using vnc. will that prevent me from doing that?
yes, but usually vnc doesn't work that way (usually connects to an existing session). There's probably some way to set that up though but not known to me sorry..  [URL] (although note that XDMCP doesn't have a great security reputation)
maybe a more specific hotkey -> cool compiz reaction effect would be more correct to say
I didn't even know about s+a+up arrow until I saw it on that menu
do you mean reload?.  do you mean "reload". is that the same as refresh
sure... I don't have it open here P. :P
that's terrible, . perhaps bill gate was hurt, but he's really a good guy deep inside
we all have love inside people just try to fight it. i love wobbly boxes that is why i am here, my friend
why do you think people try to fight the love that they have inside?. man! I feel like a woman.
i do not know, maybe the stress and demands of the modern world life
the latest official release.  10.10
is this the 1st distro you have tried-I assume you are trying 10.10??
on this laptop yeah. one more info of interest: on first install it could log in, but after installing updates this problem occured.  now after reinstalling the sys - new partitions, etc - the problem arises immediately
you may want to look here to see if anyone else has same prob [URL]
I will, thanks
I am always leery of upgrades-unless it's to a LTS distro
oh, why is your client running mountd,nfs,and status? that is not necessary.
because I tried to get nfs to work.. still doesn't.
from the client run `rpcinfo -p <server>`
it just sits there, no output
That is your problem, your server is not responding to portmap requests from the client. firewall??
no firewall :/
try running `rpcinfo -p` on the server.
I get portmapper, status, nfs, nlockmgr, mountd
well i had a nVidia N280 running duel monitors, but the card burned up so now im temporarly using the onboard intel card. seems thats when this started
using 9.04?
oops wrong channel, sorry
Not acceptable anywehre it is an opin ion.
i think they know better so i can't blame it on ignorance just disrespect for others
your faith in the human condition knows no bounds
i did. I partitioned /dev/sda into 3 partitions, /sda1 = ext3, sda2 = swap sda3/4 are unformatted at this time. it I only have sda1 checked for format in manual but at the end where it summarizes all the changes made I keep getting 3 hard drives being shown up as going to be formated. :(. the first one being my primary IDE which I don't want to format.
unhook it
In 14.04 have samba4 where some things changed. without in*
oh ok, that's too bad i hate making the samba config files. is there an alternate tool to do this?
Have you tried system-config-samba app? BTW your nick is from Pacific Rim movie isn't it?
i've been  for about 15 years :). i'll check it out thanks for the tip
what do you mean?
desktop and the server version are basically the same, just install services onto the desktop version..  check out "sudo tasksel" to get some general server type options
what does it mean? cooling 3: Fan 0 of 1 ?.  sorry i am confused :-(
in that particular case, it's saying the 3rd fan on your computer is turned off, on would be 1
is there a tool i can use to control the fan status ?
in general, that's automatically controlled by the BIOS of your computer; there may be a way to control it manually, im not sure
will give it a try.  but I think I did try
steps 1 and 2?. I dunno ...
in gnome?
"keyboard indicator".  yes
i take it i can just search for that on msn search ?
apt-get intsall maint-guide-en (for the english version). apt-cache search maint-guide for other languages
ive only got one writable cd .. no second chances :P
no rw anywhere?
In fact the stores don't even sell red hat anymore
ewww redhat ;) thats probbly a good thing
us of a. well I mean no linux like comp usa used to have
bestbuy still has xandros and suse. and compusa carries a few flavors
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:862:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave. actually it's 2 lines: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:862:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave [00000339] oss audio output error: cannot open audio device (/dev/dsp)
then you have an issue, did the sound work previously?
well ubuntu+1 is dead. :C. question i have a bunch of updates with %3 in them. when did updated packages start shipping with %3 instead of _
I don't know I have never used Natty
I have saved on gedit
okay.  is this a laptop?
and log out. yea its a laptop
and the brightness keys on the keyboard don't work?
No. This is happening before X. I have set xrandr to disregard the rate, although it is still evident in text mode (whilst booting up)
are you using kernel mode setting?.  if so, you can use kernel parameter "video=" options
No. There is a bug with KMS on my video chip
if not, I guess you will have to rely on old framebuffer drivers, no a pleasant way, with vga= settings
eww, but if that is the only way, then so be it. Thanks. Out of curiosity, though. Where is the rate set as things stand right now? Is it read from the EDID before X loads? I am thinking along the lines of changing it manually, as it is obviously set -somewhere-
I'm not sure, but kernel has lower level video control
You think it is possible I set the configuration incorrectly when I configured the kernel?
if it works with default ubuntu livecd, then, you know for sure, something wrong with your kernel
Good point. Thanks for your help
for me, the ubuntu livecd gives me blank screen, so I know my kernel is better
Yeah, I had to roll my own kernel on this box owing to a 2 year old kernel bug, so I can totally identify with that. @ KMS basically wedges my GPU
what bug, do you get a bts link for it?
Not sure if you are aware, but there is an old bug with mode setting on the onboard intel video chips.  [URL]
the KMS bug I reported: [URL]
nvidia.  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GT216 [GeForce GT 330M] (rev a2)
and which driver are you using
Nvidia 280.13.  came preinstalled with 11.10
preinstalled?. I think not
ok will installed automatically. well*
ah okay.  and lspci -k | less says that's what's being used?
yep
okay. maybe you should try nouveau :D
yuk
heh.  you could try a different version of the nvidia driver, as well.  as well as different combinations of the nvidia driver version and kernel version. sometimes there are incompatibilities between the two. for ati as well
can anyone help me? how to resolve 11.10 upgrade failed?
Or don't answer, that works too I guess?
thx,
mpd is probably the "best"... mpg321, mplayer, etc. are fine for playing single files.. mpd is a music player daemon which creates a collection of your music and everything.  and mpd can be controlled via the console, with gui tools, even with a web browser..
thx, ill give it a try, i just need it to run with cron...
oh, then I suggest mplayer or mpg321 ..
edgy or dapper?
both are edgy
huh. maybe xfs wasn't the problem then
one is amd64; one is x86
i dled a .bin image and i don't want to waste burning a cd just to install something.  sort of mount - install - unmount
dont need to do that with a bin.  what app
brightness doesn't work :S. it's stuck at max
I think thats not a driver issue...
acpi_backlight=vendor doesn't seem to work, can't use the Fn keys.  what's the issue then?
is it a desktop?
the mplayer site is refusing my connection
try a mirror.  [URL]
tryed, didn't work
you typed WHAT?
Yep
tried: emerald --replace ?
Can I delete it?
yes
Thanks
you can do it manually, or sudo apt-get clean
ya, the icons
Do you know how to change icons normally?
like there is this universal access settings applet which i want to remove, or even the battery icon is showing only a graphical battery.  no i don't
Are you using gnome or unity?
gnome
I see, sec.  go here: [URL]/ then find "remove accessibilty". there should be sort of an enable button on the webpage, enable it, and it should go away. Gnome is a bit odd when it comes to the indicator applets
does this site now work in chrome?
It should. [URL] this is it
btw the other extensions which i had installed through this site earlier in 11.10 are now all showing an outdate icon before them.. what does that mean?
The extensions are not compatible with the new unity used in 12.04\. i mean gnome :). Gnome 3.4. 11.10 had 3.2 in the repos afaik
not yet but ill try it.  windows-button and t doesnt help
Hmm, weird, it is supposed to be the shortcut for Openbox on Window decoration.  [URL] - I think undoing this might help.  Alt-Shift-s might be also one option... Anyway: [URL]
thank you ill read it.  thx it helpt. perhaps you have an answer: is there a way to remove the context-menu-entry "decorate/remove decoration"
Not really sorry, I am also have just browsed through the Wiki too... I am using Gnome 2
thank you. i want to set up a desktop office with lxde for testing in daily use by my office ladys and this option costs me an hour experimenting
I understand that, unfortunately I can't help you further. Why don't you leave the decorations, it would make it look nicer
yes thats right, but when im working without decoration, the users cant move the windows in there used way
Oh, I see
todaay they are used to work at gnome 2 on debian squeeze
Since your questions are all around OpenBox only I think more experienced users of OpenBox might be able to help further
dafty how might I go about doing either of those things
"ps -ef"
Okay one sec
throw it in a pastebin. or run "sudo apt-get install pastebinit" then "ps -ef | pastebinit". yes left shift. then edit the boot line to read 'text' next to 'quite splash'. *quiet. ooh factoid \o/
and how do I do that?
try apt-cache search fiame or google really
yes.. and i have.. with no answer
Could you repeat your question? As you can see, it's quite busy, and questions can be easily missed by people who know the answer. If you don't get an answer, it's best to wait for a few minutes and try again.
i had a working setup of 10.10 with 4 monitors.. ever since i installed 12.04.. i have been screwed..
What's the definition of 'screwed' in your scenario? What issues occur?
Yeah, I have an EasyCAP device too
should be /dev/video0 or /dev/video1 or /dev/video2 depending on how many video devices you have plugged in
no. but then somehow there were 2 firefox i think on my computer. and the other settings just wiped out my current one
restore from a backup. You have been making bkacups of your home folder haven't you?
nope
Perhaps now is a good time to adopt a backup scheme
i didn't deleted it. delete
heheh joking. try installing build-essential.
i just did, but ok, i try again
kennethlove: and kernel-headers maybe.  i meant ;)
yes, I fill all that and also adding current user to revaliases..  I try explicitly telling AuthMethod=LOGIN. but no success :(
Can you run sendmail -v <your_address> and capture the debug output? I also use AuthMethod=LOGIN.
I did and here my last error message "sSMTP[6846]: Server didn't like our AUTH LOGIN (530 5.7.0 Must issue a STARTTLS command first. ms1sm977391pbb.63)"
I assume you have UseSTARTTLS=YES and mailhub=[URL]:587
ok, thanks, didn't know it existed. But found it already
er, #compiz-fusion. ok
by the way, do you know if there is a good place to ask for apparmor help?
um... I dunno
yes but I have a dualboot setup here and it works great my video card needs a safe mode boot
what's stopping you from going to Edgy at least :P.  for Pidgin just add [URL] repo
because im comfortable have the video card driver working and dont need headache :P
mm k :)
so just type this in term? [URL] repo. how to add
no.  go to the website and see the instructions
any other alternative?
not offhand .  actually, your laptop may have some tracking functionality in the bios.
[URL] This is my laptop
yeah, no i'm not reading all that. contact HP to ask if you can enable tracking on that device at the hardware level
from a usb disk.  from a usb stick *. i created usb stick using usb-creator from other ubuntu laptop
ok, did you do an md5sum check on it?
no. but i had the same issue with other version of ubuntu too
yeah you probably need to re-doanload the iso?
not sure if it has anything to do with my laptop
did you test run it before installing?
ya
and that worked?
ya. thats what puzzles me
ok wellrun the !md5 on it. (the iso. )
Oh, boy.. Never do that again.. Which usually does in home Internet connections.
Uh, the update doesn't really rely on an Internet connection. Once everything's downloaded you can unplug it
mom, testing.  same behavior it seems like gconftool and gconf-editor use 2 different databases...
So doing it in gconf-editor works, but gconftool doesn't?
NotBot: I heard that this abbreviation is only common under german mmorpg-players... :-)
If so, how are you running the script? Is it a cronjob?
no, both don't work.  only works by using UI
Oh. Hm. Maybe you're changing something in metacity while using compiz or vice versa?
compiz is running for blingbling... :-)
For a quick and dirty way to see what doing it with the UI changes, do the change in the UI, then run find ~ -mmin -2 to see what files have been changed in the last two minutes.
~/.gnome2/backgrounds.xml is changed
Aha, then I guess your script needs to edit that file instead, then.
julian It will look like "kernel /boot/vmlinuz-(numbers here)-generic root=UUID=(long code here) ro quiet splash". julian Only yours would be missing the "splash" part and may have other keywords.. julian You may have to update each boot entry you want it to apply to.
yea i just checked and it does have splash on the right line already
julian ... and there's not a "nosplash" entry?. julian ... and you're sure that's the line you booted from?
this is what my line says: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root=UUID=407b146a-2116-4c8c-9745-92fba881bfd3 ro quiet splash vga=791
ubuntu just froze while using shotwell, then teamviewer crashed, and then typing was impossible (menu bar was selected and you typed there sort of like holding Alt). any ideas?. how do i deal with that?. the pc is my uncle's
How long have you ben having this problems?
thanks, I'll check that out.
kewl
ok, so how can I fix?
Is it ntfs / fat 32 format?
I believe my problem is not included in the thread.
can you pastebin your /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  also, can you check if /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober execute bit is on?
[URL] Severity: I got only other OS than ubuntu.
okay i checked your cfg and.... it looks like your 30_os-prober is functioning proerly since it detected MACOSX
Yes , Only Mac OSX although I have also windows.
yes it should have been detected by 30_os-prober together with MocOS
Is it possible that there is a problem with windows itself?
it is possible, your on 10.04 right?
Severity: Yes.
do you remember on which partition you put Windows?
Yes..  Are you suggesting to add the entry manually?
yup. you can manually add boot entries in 40_custom under /etc/grub.d.  you still there?
Yes..  I am searching for a howto for 40_custom, I can hardly find one.
im also looking for templates for Windows.  its also possible that your windows xp MBR is broken
Yes
Are you using the 64 bit fear server?
Mm  i think is for the bot 64 and 32
You can check which arch it's for with "file fearserver.bin"
Wait . [] i dont understand much waht are u saying, can be more especific, sorry for my bad english
In the directory that contains fearserver.bin run "file ./fearserver.bin" and pastebin the output.
or last write date
yes, last modified is there. You should be able to use that, but I'm no bash scripting hero.
tx
something like 'filestat filename | grep Modify' combined with awk to get the date and then compare with your variable
the 4GB space isn't formatted yet, and Qparted won't let me format :-/
lemme guess: the 4gb unallocated space is wedged between /sda3 and the start of the extended partitions.
not really sure, LOL. doesn't look like it though. should I upload a screencap?
that'd help
Is there any way to tell which systems would be afflicted?
afflicted?.  sorry Im lost with that question
: Your version of PHP does not include PostgreSQL support. (according to apache)
did you restart after installing ?
yes
so edit /etc/hosts to add an IP and a domain - but bear in mind if you use a *real* domain, the internet-based one won't work anymore
ok. can you give me an code example
it'll be pretty obvious, you're adding two things... an IP, and a domain
like is : 127.0.1.1 victor-[URL] ?
yep, although 127.0.0.1 technically
ok. ill try. Server not found
when trying to do what?
computer can replay pings but another computer cant found
yes these changes only work on *your* computer. because /etc/hosts is only a local file
ok i wanna make it work in my inter net
your home network, you mean
choronographer how? ive been googling it.... no luck
Dr_Willis: keyboard works fine in console, and xev reports correct keys, how should I fix it in gnome?. dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg <- I think. backup your xorg first
I did. I can't geet SublimeClang to work. I got clang3.0 from the software center, I even downloaded it separtely and made sue the [URL] is in the right place...and I don't get an error loadig [URL] anymore, but nothing happens now.
I have no clue what you are trying to do and have some vague idea of what you did to resolve your issue after reading that.
Sorry.. Thanks Yatesy.. I've been away from linux too long :)
np
~/.bash_aliases, adn added line to ~/.bashrc
dhuv: Then open it in your favourite text editor, and edit the hintstyle. "Thick" fonts is 'slight' or 'none'..  Do you have a ~/.profile, or ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.bash_login? (Any of these.).  If yes, does it contain a line saying '. ~/.bashrc' or 'source ~/.bashrc'?
but shouldn't fdisk take care of that?
what are you trying to do?
The last I checked this drive mounted on a Mac (two partitions).  reformat it and DD my computer's hard drive partitions to it
since the last time you check, that hard drive chould have failed. im not saying it has...  i would use gparted, and seee if i can format the driver. drive*
Ok, I'll give that a go.  thanks
good luck!..
that would've been good to know before three reboots and changes :/.  thanks!
yeah. check out the grub documentation.
thank you. Can you assist me with anything else here - [URL] ?
i've seen fedora, wasn't impressed.  you familiar with hosts file?
I know there is one in /etc/hosts but I do not fully understand the syntax for editing it
i'm fuzzy there too, but edit it a bit and just keep track of your changes, google.  the rest is just going to /var/www/ and making the directories they're listing, and put the file there.  what's really fun, is you can run traffic through your system then and they will be redirected to you
to use as a media server..... what distro should u use?
u dont need server distro for that purpose
Haven't yet seen a usecase that likes vulnerable kernels or glibc :)
still needs to be connected to the net. I have internal servers that it doesn't matter
yes it absolutely does matter
? really... explain
i have a server listening/accepting udp-connection at port 5060. But clients can't connect for some reason....  My firewall is disabled, server-app is running. when i listen to the ethernet wire i can hear that the client traffic is sent to the server correctly
hm so the server must be misconfigured somehow
Yea. i think so. I dont know what files to edit :)
what server is it?
its an IP PBX, for sip phone calls.  asterisk
does "man asterisk" give you any info about configuration and/or config files?
yea, the command echoes back a bunch of info in my terminal.
"man asterisk" should show the manual pages for the application, you can quit it with "q" and scoll with page-up/down
((((((((  ))))))))))
I'm all mended after the flip over the bars.
Does anyone know how I can use PAE?. ok gmlap
actually... i think hugepages is just PSE... i think you need to compile your kernel correctly
yes. no mention of how to fix issue i am facing though. just a description of what it does and how to run the script
and which part of that script is giving errors
thanks.. doesn't work :/ Maybe this mouse does not support a USB -> PS2 adapter
with PS2 mice quite often you have to reboot (or even powercycle) with the mouse plugged in as the machine starts up before it will work.  I've even had cases where the PS2 mouse wont work without a PS2 keyboard plugged in, and vice versa
I think I did that. I do have a PS2 keboard..  I guess a reboot won't hurt though :).  is there any way before X starts that I can test the mouse device?
you could try cat /dev/psaux I guess, or maybe install gpm and start that using psaux (gpm -d /dev/psaux or something) - gpm gives you mouse cursor / clipboard in virtual consoles
thnx

for some reason the computer keeps adding 192.168.0.1 into my DNS list, and its keeping the browser from working
: it shouldnt.
I know, but it is. (:
lool
so, can i join any channel from any network?
not quite... it depends which house <channel> decided to reside in.  for example, many linux help rooms are located in the FreeNode house
now all i have to do is connect to this channel #desipirate. How do i do it?
to join a channel, write /j #channelname. my sound disappears when i wake my laptop from 'suspend to ram'... anyone got a hint of what might be wrong? please, anyone ;)
just did, after upgrade my ldap is not working.  if I create /var/lib/ldap/accesslog it starts but it doesn't seem to have the old configuration
is that a server? if yes, try #ubuntu-server
Hmm. The machine is at home. DWL-650, I think. Anyway, it works with the madwifi driver, but with Debian,. I have to build it myself.
my bad, I was talking about the wrong computer, anyhow I do have that card for my laptop and it work fine, with no extra firmware. Have you tried to plug it in yet?
it is a keyboard/mouse combo from logitech
Does it have a lot of special keys?
Cool, I have a problem with my graphics card drivers. :[
k whats wrong?
[URL] was working fine i8,04...but now when i look at it at "top" its said 0 used.should i stop the swap and turn it back on again?
check gparted.  right click on linux-swap and see if you have the option to turn off swap, if so, its running, but you don't have enough used memory to need swap
yeah its unuse....filetype linux-swap
unuse? right click properties, is it active?
yup its active... and i did what u [URL]s still 0 use on my "top" command
that just means swap is not needed yet, ubuntu chooses to use swap when its needed.  are you having a problem?
give me the link pls
in terminal man sis iirc
how to install the driver?
it should have come with X afaik.  no man page?
i dont understand what to do install the driver from man page.
if there's a man page it prob is installed - checked the xorg log to see if it is used?
i cant found /etc/X11/[URL]nf
doesn't get made automatically these days - read /var/log/Xorg.0.log
i found failed to load module "sis"
is the module in the path that the log lists
yeahh would be nice
ok, sec..  the first one is even in German ;) http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
it's installed
have you updated recently?
yes, i just installed the new hoary yesterday
do the event sounds seem normal?
i have a nice sound at the beginning, but then, it's always the very quick sound that looks like a buggy sound
in a terminal, type "killall -9 esd"
how do you mean? i want to be able to connect to my computer from any computer, not just the ones on the network
yes, but you may want to check and see if you can connect at all, before you get to the /from anywhere/
okok. doesnt work in xterm either for me. :S. brb. reboot
try "locale" and make sure everything says UTF-8
then?
fix it
i will ty. crush_grove, do you mean getting kernel updates or recompiling your kernel
be aware the max texture size defaults to 2048x2048 (from the thread)
what?
that you should be using upstart override files, not update-rc.d
yes.  but will it be accessibale on windows and mac ?
no, well yes, windows and mac have gnupg tools, but overall it will be encrypted, so unaccessable from everywhere until you enter a password
ya that's cool.  even windows admin can not open it, right ?
right
correct wpa/wep key
fallensparrow: yes
have you tried traceroute, adn pin. see if you can ping the router itself
fallensparrow: I have tried all of that
is this YOUR wireless connection
yes it is. fallensparrow:yes it is
connect with wire, download all updates. restart, see if that fixes issue, a lo of times my lap has an issue grabbing new networks until i reboot
fallensparrow: what updates i am running the latest version of ubuntu
okok expalain exactly what is going on
fallensparrow: may I pm you?
enter jobs?. they are there in crontab
you just need to define jobs in crontab....there is nothing to enable
<> do you know of any webpages which list the commands?
[URL]
yes, what i'm saying is i want to exclude certain files
oh, i thought you *wanted* to have the hidden files. sorry about that. Then id think that selecting only all the files in a dir will copy only them and not the hidden once..
cool. yeah he messaged me. and he did not pass my turing test:-P
Oh, he's a retard, surely. <heh>
:) hehe
but say idiot savant, perfect memory recall ;-)
thx.  what iis the difference between dm-crypt and using a loop device?
sorry, no idea
yes, didn't work
can you boot some rescue cd?
I could burn a live cd, yeah.. what would I be able to do from a live cd?
if you can boot a rescue cd (best to make a CDRW, these things outdate far too quick) (or USB) you can look at /etc/grub/default. since your screen goes black right after grub, there's probably some funky stuff in your kernel bootline
I can edit grub. It boots to grub, just the second I pick any option, even single user made or xforcevesa, I lose a signal.
if there is and you remove it, run update-grub. hmm oh wait for that you need the system to actually run (or chroot). you can boot grub with a custom line. there perhaps you can remove whatever is messing things up. booting some alternative media you could blacklist nvidia, but I don't know if that would work
recover mode worked if I removed $linux_gfx_mode from it. odd
[URL] ?.  looks like you should post that thread, maybe that'll reactivate it
But when I change it in the GUI tool, it gets changed back whenever I connect to a different access point
thats cos it gets new info from DHCP. if you use DHCP there is no way to stop it getting the DNS info for that interface I dont think
bah. Ok, thanks
you could create a sample [URL]nf file and make a script which replaces your current one with it, then you'd just have to run that each time to save you editing it
nah, that's too much work
ok. it'll be less work than editing it each time, however..  whats the matter with other DNS servers anyway?
delete produces the error "unable to create trash directory
are you selecting "move to trash" instead of "delete"?
Cant find it
you need to add the PPA says the page [URL] [URL]/
uh. i will try
i installed ubuntu restricted extras exactly the way i told you
Ubuntu restricted extras (not avaible). this is the message
after you clicked "apply changes" ?
i try REFRESH. but i can't check it
are you in the add/remove application ?
I have already disabled all visual effects in the appearance menu. (if that is it)
Hmm. Im out if ideas then
so i changed it manually.  yes
now try glxgears
never mind, i ran it and it didnt work. im not sure if its the gui or parted
any error messages?
It is contantly present in firefox at least.... Maybe it's firefox's dictionary
can you specify what you mean by 'it is present'?
I see the graphical user logins, I just can't select anything as the touchpad and keyboard seem to be frozen
sometimes somethign freeze cuz u have to reinstall graphic card dirver if u upgraded kernel.  can u boot in safe graphic mode?
no, that seems to hang.  no, I can't boot into safe graphic mode. It seems to hang and I don't get to login
dont knwo what else we could do. there can be many reasons u cant boot
Thx. I'll try on Ubuntuforums.
what graphic card do you have?. could please someone make coffee two sugar not milk for me ?
I'm getting an error when starting a network monitor... error: [URL]
have you configged the gdesklet to use the right device, example: eth0
yup. It actually works.... just that it gives me that error every time I load it...
have you tried more then 1 desklet?
I have heaps of others that work fine... I haven't tried a different network monitor, no.
try another one, maybe that one is coded wrong, and are you using eth0 for internet?
will do. yes, I am using eth0
okay
i see.. i have yet to use it, there isnt even a release afaik
ooc, what was the alternate method or something you mentioned about those monodep dependencies (i.e. why was my patch wrong?). *monodevelop
which one on the list?. they all look the same to me =/
what kind of processor?
intel. and I beleive it has 64 bit support. allthough I am running 32 bit windows
core i something or core 2 something?. the one that says amd64
but, isn't that only amd cpu support?
nope
No networking problems?
not on wifi. I can't speak to ethernet as I never use it.
Alright. Can you guide me to setup my hacking lab??
install ubuntu 14.04.2. Get the latest vbox from oracle. install it. install distro of choice to vbox. configure network passthrough
I face problems configuring the network part.
different advice based on different goals ... best to ask the #vbox for your specific requirements
which just printed "initilizing installshield wizard, extracting installation archive" and then returned me to the prompt.  Ah, forgot about that handy feature.  hmm... the synaptic does not have eny entry on netbeans
i fear you are correct
let me guess telnet?
SSH. using protocol 2
your opinion sucks then
wow.  no need to be an as
what would the options be on that command?
I'm not sure what you're asking
usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
ah, none.
it won't work with $sudo --force-remove-rinstreq mozilla-imagezoom
what kind of error message? Package unknown or the like?
usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v usage: sudo [-HPSb] [-p prompt] [-u username|#uid] { -e file [...] | -i | -s | <command> }
you missed the most important thing: sudo dpkg --force-remove-rinstreq mozilla-imagezoom (the dpkg command)
lol. ok, I'm a newb at this.
the dpkg command is the command that is doing something, and sudo just lets you do it with adminstrative privileges
understood..  $ sudo dpkg --force-remove-rinsteq mozilla-imagezoom dpkg: unknown force/refuse option `remove-rinsteq'
misspelled: --force-remove-reinstreq
example.. I have gregg username and I want to change it to happy.  once logged..what to do next?
sudo -u user can change the user you're running as, if that what is you're looking for
Ah, OK. In that case I've tried both, and both exhibit the same behaviour.. (But the classic versions, compiz & metacity, are fine)
weird your xorg session got same issue..
I don't have a File Type under Content
which version of Firefox?
1.5.0.9
okay, mine applies to 2.0.  hold on, I've got a dapper machine to check
ok, thanks
.  got it
go ahead

IdIeOne, i try to find it there but i can't find it. IdIeOne, lol i found it sorry!
np
just use it
do you mean there will be an update to the kernel or acpi package? what could be the reason?
kk_jonty that time is only estmated
yes but in my case the estimate is coming almost right..  which is not the right estimate for sure.
batterys ware out. kk_jonty set britness lower turn off wifi/blurtooth/card reader
if that was just a guess then my system hould have stayed on beyond 2 hours but it called off for a system shut down with low battery message
kk_jonty that will get more time from the battery
I am sorry, i did not get what u said?
kk_jonty you probly had more stuff on so it used more power
yes i thought so as well, but this is happening consistently in same situations and workload where I used to get more backup..  the fun part is that I am totally blind and i do turn off my moniter
i can get 5 hrs off my 4 cell with wifi bluetooth sd card reader off
and still no improvements on the battery status
maybe the batterys waring out
I got it just a couple of months back and as I told you on another machine the battery behaves nicely.
wifi can cut your battry time in half
if I asume your idea of waiting for the laptop to learn the real battery power? do you have any idea what is this problem, I mean how does the acpi take time to learn?
sometimes it does have to relern.  but it sounds like the battery needs to be checked
I did
you have a warelevel metor?
went to the service center and they confirmed that the battery has 3% ware means it must give me 3 hours 5 minits battery.  it was their calculation
then wifi is probly taking a hr
and hardy still takes it perfect
they extmate max
I am very sure that this is some kind of an acpi problem. that's why I was wondering if there was some one in the room who could assist me to find a patch if avaliable
probly 3 and a half without wifi on.  if thats a dule core 2hrs sounds right if using wifi.  my hp dies in 2. in windows or linux
wifi was off and it is a r 60 lenovo with dual core
off oe just not connected.  did you tuern it off with the hotkey
hot kye?
key. or switch. depending on the laptop
I have a physical switch which is on the off position
oh. streange
yes .  else you will rarely find me in this room asking usual questions
have you looked on google for some acpi stuff just for your pc
yes
my eee had some scripts. gave me another 2 hrs. on a 4 cell heh
which scripts?
where called eee acpi scripts. just for those thow. i bet acpi isnt underclocking in battery mode. check your power mangment settings
another interesting observation, the command acpi always gives me some strange output like some times it says 4 hours remaining and some times 2 ours. while the function + f3 key gives me consistent 2 hours response..  I wonder whether these 2 outputs are from the same source?.  interesting isn't it?
what laptop was it. lets see what i can find
thanks a lot. ibm lenovo thinkpad r 60.  is not just "lenovo " but "ibm lenovo " meaning it was bought 18 months back
okay.. Thanks . if i disable the animations will that make the computer slightly faster?
if you want a more lightweight desktop use something like xfce or lxde.
A MAC address for the the wifi card or for the router? I do get what looks like a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig..  Sorry, that last comment was directed at you. I do have what appears to be a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig, and of course the wifi card's MAC address is listed in ifconfig
okay. Huh... I think I've reached the end of my expertise on this subject, then. :/
I uncommented it and gave it the right directory a sample .torrent but it not downloading it.. yes.
let me check my config file.  schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/home//.torrents/*.torrent.  and next row is: schedule = untied_directory,5,5,stop_untied=
thanks rampage. and thanks for the help last night
you're welcome
done verything
could be a pulse audio issue hanging in another session
i mean general stuff
pulseaudio running?
i dnt know. how to check that
press "alt F2".  and type: pulseaudio &.  after that, retry opening the sound stuff
it doesnt work
try "alt F2" and afterwards: pulseaudio -d
:nop
if this does not work, killing pulseaudio and restarting would be an idea..  run the command: pulseaudio -k.  afterwards pulseaudio -d. and retry
12.04
then it comes with Gnome3 by default
i've added a ppa ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3.  actually it only brought unity
why, precise comes with gnome3, why are you adding PPAs?.  Unity is a shell, 12.04 uses Gnome.  Unity is not a replacement for Gnome.  if you install ppa-purge you can remove the ppa and it should reinstall the official gnome3
i removed the ppa from software center. is that ok?
that won't reinstall the originals, like ppa-purge does
do I want to create disc from contents or burn as file?
your choice ?
tried both
how did you configure samba?
i have tried several instruction lists....guess i am just too stupid. well
not stupid, just inexperienced
how do I tell if it found it then?.  how do I find out if it found it?
System -> Adminisration -> Printing
nope doesn't see it
on the "Server Settings" tab, make sure "Show printers shared by other systems" is checked
it is.  its not showing up
you're running hardy?
yea
sounds like a windows-side error, imho
how do i view/close current terminal sessions?
type "exit" in it
I got it to work :) I just put modprobe alx and dhclient eth0 in rc.local so it happens ever boot. I guess it's better than nothing. maybe one day Ubuntu will include drivers for this thingy by default.
Yeah, I was just typing that...
I'm in Ubuntu server so no network manager for me, if you're talking about a gui thing.
When you rebooted, did you check to see if the module was loaded before the manual 'modprobe alx'?
No I didn't, I don't know enough to :P. I barely know what I'm doing now. I just learned what blah | grep something did :D. that pipe is neat, chaining commands
Because it might have been loaded and you just need to modify '/etc/network/interfaces' to have it bring up the interface automagically..  Oh, bash one-liners are my favorite..  I'm not sure what device is created by loading the module, but you might also solve your issue, assuming the module is loading, by adding something like 'auto wlan0' and 'iface wlan0 inet dhcp'.
nice, I'll try it
Up to you if you wanna reboot to see if the module is loading.
Another question, it's not very Ubuntu-y, but does anyone know a good dynamic dns service that allows multiple domains to be pointed at one dynamic IP?
Goog luck..  Don't know. I only use one, and only one domain.
yeah, i can drag windows, but panel stays in-place.  can't drag it, i tried
try holding down ALT and dragging
thanks mate. and another question about 2 monitors, compiz stopped working..... any reason why compiz shouldn't work with a dual monitor system?
someone mentioned yesterday that dualmonitor with ubuntu's compiz can cause issues (i didn't experience that), you might want to ask in #compiz if you don't get an answer here first. Good luck.
its really a question: Is it possible to fast swithc keyboard language?. like in windows you can press alt `shift to do it
have you posted this question on Ubuntu forums?
i have a Acer Aspire timeline X 5820tg 6406, with an ATI radeon HD 6550m.
Go to [URL] and search for the model number. Somebody has posted a script.
how do I find out if it is compatible? what about the blueray drive? network card? sound card? nVidia GeForce GTX260SE?
idea*
hmm why?
i have one
but will it require manual configuration on my part?
a couple clicks...
I have two users on my server, and one user on my client. The problem is that I use key logins, and for both users on the server, it prompts me for the same rsa keyphrase!.  I have separate keys for each user on the server... but it just prompts me for one key every time...
Sorry, I am not familiar with using keys and SSH. Perhaps someone else here may be able to help.
it returns 868
when you do a sudo crontab -e ?
no crontab for root - using an empty one. 29
hmm dunno -- it works priv/unpriv for me.
i made a cron file a while back on 8.  now I am getting emails set from my script. all over sudden. There is a .sh tied to cron somewhere that updates my IP.  how do I look into that crob job?
easeast way is just to edit the file: crontab -e or sudo crontab -e
Oh, that was a bot.. I guess .. Tnx
yw
vimtutor must come in another package? If so, which?
errm, try this command to list all available vim packages -- aptitude search vim
it displays nothing. !fr
plain <unconvertable> sudo lshw -C Network <unconvertable> ?
i got some output now
look for the stanza belonging to tyour wireless card and read the configuration line.  in there there should be information on the driver it uses ?
i see my 3 ones  did it type them right. 0 0 * * 2,3,4,5,1 sudo rtcwake -l -s 108000 -m mem. 0 7 * * 2,3,4,5,1 sudo rtcwake -l -s 28800 -m mem. 0 0 * * 1,0,6 pmi action suspend
you cant add sudo to cron
so do i just remove sudo from it
you need to run: sudo crontab -e , to edit root's crontab and add the commands without sudo
and  the 3rd line should have ran last night at midnight and it didnt
if the commands need sudo to work, you need to cron as root, not your user
0 0 * * 2,3,4,5,1 rtcwake -l -s 108000 -m mem. 0 7 * * 2,3,4,5,1 rtcwake -l -s 28800 -m mem. 0 0 * * 1,0,6 pmi action suspend. and  how do i do that
do what?
root
you need to run: sudo crontab -e , like I already said, and cron as root if the command needs root access
how? im trying to share a whole ntfs partition with windows
sharing over the network or sharing between installed systems on the same machine?
yeah looks like I can run commands to key bindings. hmm
you try this? [URL]
pretty. so if i find my windows partition to the right, that's the application using it? because if so, it's irssi, which i just started... and i couldn't unmount before that either
do you have a terminal open, where you are in the windows-directory?. oh. gone. nice.
Yeah, okay, quitting irssi didn't help at all :P. I don't want to shut down without safely unmounting the partition, last time I did that I corrupted a lot of files
what says lsof <where your windows partition is>
bash and irssi. bash is because i'm attempting to unmount i guess. and irssi, i have no idea, but i just quit it and that didn't help
wah, if my english was a little bit better.. but anyhow, i think you have a terminal open, where you sit in your windows-partition....  ?
Hmm, I don't have any terminals accessing the win partition.  Maybe some unlisted X applications or something?. I have no clue
then what says lsof /path/to/your/windows-partition say exactly
I have no idea how to copy-paste in bash... But it says bash and irssi are accessing it, bash probably being lsof itself?.  But I guess I'll just give up... It's 5:15 in the morning :P I'll just shut down without unmounting and hope for the best.  Thanks for the help :)
linux is confusing sometimes..
I install e17 and openbox and it did install a lot of other packages. I don't know how to emove it completely
SOmeting along the lines of: sudo apt-get purge openbox obconf obmenu.  But use at your own risk :).  The after, sudo apt-get autoremove
OHh, so its built into that i gotta enable that some how :)
correct, read the links above
yes what?
yes, I recommend to install 10.10 or 10.04
both????
nah, that'd take far too much space..  if you're on a home system, 10.10 is probably the way to go. It has the most up to date software.
it worked fine when i had win 7
flash has gpu acceleration on windows and is more efficient.
which?
search MucsicTracker pidgin plugin. int Tools --> Plugins
but apt-get install [URL]b doesnt work of course
apt-get install skype
not sre. *not sure
apt-cache search gaim
you use madwifi?
no. :p
hm ok thx
also, xorg gives some output when you start it with startx
while googleling i found out that alot of people have driver issues, especially with the 5000 series... so i thought there might be some good hints or tutorials out :(
so you can do startx from a terminal, then switch back to it and see the output
ok thank you =)
you could try the open source driver, see if that works, and if it does, it may mean a bug in ATI's driver. That might not be helpful though.
yes, 2.5.8. !info pidgin
well then I don't know what to tell you... Unless you want to hunt down the leak and fix it yourself? =)
I have tried 1.5 1.6 and 1.7 from repository but all give me err:seh. On my other laptop with 32-bit 12.04 and wine 1.3.28 my apps work
!info wine.  what's the output of cat /etc/issue
this is a problem with Ubuntu 12.04 wines. 64bit
!info wine lucid
hmm i have killed it butc what cause it use 100% cpu....  could it be cause of an attack?
Unlikely. Sounds like something is broken.
fairly detailed I guess. It will be used to monitor a webserver's / my networks network usage ;). not too detailed....  what did you have in mind?
have you done a search for a list of network monitoring apps on your source list?
ok. into the main chat?
no
k
see topicj regarding pastebin
I don't think that will fix it, I think it's some bug in nm. it seems hard coded to use eth0. yet it was working until the first time I plugged it in. eh. and now it has worked again. this is weird
-> do this, when it works, right down the contents of ifconfig; iwconfig; route -n ; cat /etc/[URL]nf;
i'm trying but having difficulty....  the biggest problem is there seems to be this huge drag on the system.
like lag?
everythign seems.. slow... playing music gets gitttery.. when i switch virtual desktops
using unity?
no, kde..  this is a 16gb of ram, 6 core machine.. it shouldn't seem laggy!
monitor a process/activity monitor see what's consuming the cpu
i did that.... folding at home is using a lot of cpu (but it runs in idle so not an issue).  nothin else really shows up
how about ram?
16gb of ram, 8gb in use, no swap..  i have a hunch it's realted to video.. nvidia.. because lots of display changes seems to be linked.. but i can't be sure.
then the only way is to test that, using compiz? disable it, then if no changes swap between no driver, open source and proprietry. before all this though update everything and maybe restart the session or even the pc
my #1 concern is a drive is failing at this moment.. is there any way to test if the problem is IO bound?.  how can you install "different version" of drivers using apt?.  using gentoo I would "emerge nvidia-drivers-version#". but with apt I can't seem to find a way to specifiy a version. i'd like to downgrade. or upgrade. and see if it makes a diff
unistall proprietry then use 'nouveau'. !nouveau
i really don't want to give up 3d, it would be a majorpita..  but using a diff version # would work, is this possible?
no real way to check hdd besides using a livecd health check like application. brb
wait, what?.  I know the difference between --skip- and --keep-old-files now in 1.27. My question is this: as far as I can tell from reading the messages, --skip-old-files in 1.27 is equivalent to -k/--keep-old-files **in 1.26**.. Is that incorrect?
in the end: no duplicates are overwritten: yes..  but not in the messages you see while its done
imap
so you have a problem making imap connection using evolution. standard imap, port 143?
yes, but also doesn't work on 465
telnet HOSTNAME 143.  if telnet opens, then: 0 LOGIN username password.  0 is part of command, replace username and password with correct ones
the pure connection is not the problem. it doesn't show any errors and thunderbird is working fine through that port. but evolution doesn't download any mail, although thunderbird does
can you please try to login as stated, using telnet, and by typing in the credentials you are using in evolution?
I have used evolution but removed it.
did you remove evolution related packages, such as evolution-common or evolution-data if they exist?.  also, did you apt-get remove or purge
i installed that earlier actually. how do I config it?
no clue check their site
know one that plays FM channels? or do those also?
many radiostations provide stream, or do you speak of a receicer-card
No, I just used the networking config and it searched and found them and that ws it.
what type of wireless card do you have?
I prefer to have a standalone "boot master" partition -- such that if the OS that is managing the 'master boot', messes up, I can easily still boot into other OS. the wiki link I refered to outlines the concept
YOu need it in the mbr as well
Apple ibook
the howto is horribly written, I think I'm gonna write one this afternoon. but i can walk you thru it.
I have it installed, but it's sporadic. I read something about wl_apsta.o firmware
mine's fine - rock steady.  are you using ndiswrapper or the built in driver?
I can't use ndiswrapper, being on PPC.
didn't know that :)
There's a special firmware some howtos said to use, but the fwcutter refuses to extract it.
did you try /usr/share/bcm43xx-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh. yet? to download all drivers from the net?. as root
rgr. it only finds the source that i installed. and the version driverloader i tried to install
ndiswrapper-utils
. same here. down with micro$oft
agreed
clipboar?. d
ah I see :). xcdroast I think. also a CD burner for warty is here (in the warty directory) [URL] hayden: if you are using warty I suggest the link above. you can install the .deb with sudo dpkg -i <nameofdeb>
is gnea a bot?. any linux heads in here. oops. <> !away | . i was confused by that. thought was bot. :)
clearly :)
when I type 'iwconfig', it says me that the device isn't ready...
you got the kernel module loaded?
and when I try ifconfig it, I get a "timeout expiration"
and wlan0 is present?
not wlan0, eth0.... but the module prism54 is loaded
should be that alright.  what card is it exactly?
i don't know, this is what i look for
do 'aptitude' then. and read the options
Luca: Negative....it is a Gateway DX4720
I have nothing todo so ill google a bit for you
23Meg D/L that unpacks to 84Meg please tell me it's not installing KDE on my machine

its always been /dev/sda1 when I was in fedora, its my only sata drive so I think I should be safe
external usb drives also take up scsi names, so if an external usb drive grabbed sda, your sata drive might get bumped to sdb..
no I meant the external was sata, internal are all ide
is your sata drive always hooked up?
talk in private chat?.  can we talk in private chat?????
yea  i am messaging you : )
so i am just outta luck b/c i am running 64bit ?
try to find source pkgs or use a chroot 32bit environment
nmbd: unrecognized service
then try sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
whys that
with that you can set the mouse sensitivity
er why no need for defrag
it's no fat32 coily
what prevents ext3 from getting fragmented
why should a filesystem fragment?
chris_: i have done tha it dont work or i am not setting it up righ t
is it a local printer?
doesn't this tell me to do it to a partition? [URL]
no idea if OSX does some weird black magics, but the idea is you dd to a device since it will bring MBR with partition layout and bootloader with it
ok will try that. strange that that site says the opposite. thanks for the tip :). also macOS probably doesn't do any black magic - it's standard dd afaik.  that works - thanks so much :)
:).  I've made that mistake myself more times than one should, so :p
yeah, but only xmms2 seems to be in the repositories. which made me wonder how well it was supported
audacios will do, you can use the xmms skin :P. audacious*
there's ext3 drivers for windows. and they load in user space
suppose it depends on what the goal of cross platform sharing is..
I used those instructions about 2 weeks ago and haven't had a problem with flash sites since
k let me try that
let me see.  it is here: [URL] nothing about the device
hmm, looks like its not connecting. Is the device a disk?
Ok, thanks
also dual core
I see. Because it output it twice ?
if you want to know if your hardware supports 64-bit do: grep /proc/cpuinfo lm.  yep
will i lose any data if i do that ?
you shouldnt. but they say it is "not recommended" to disable.  it just prevents corruption, data loss, etc. if you want the write to HFS+ from ubuntu you have to disable. here: [URL]
anyone here running ubuntu server
for what purpose?
shadowpillar: yes, MSHOME
hrmm no idea
but i have already the theme :)
It should have change during install?
i didnt install it  i dint know how
In synaptic you will have a list of software.  Then type in serarch "plymouth-theme" and there will be a list (i think
sweden
hi. ok, good luck  ;)
<unconvertable>  so why is ctrl-alt bkspace not working ( i did use displayconfig-gtk to get 1024x768 rez.) Could that have messed something up?
unfortunatlly I don't know about that one, and have you installed the graphics card driver. !repo
<unconvertable>  when I run hardware drivers, I get no proprietary drivers
damn that issue :(. Linux distros are great, but xorg isn't
<unconvertable>  should I try to select different driver when running displayconfig-gtk?
I am not sure, just stick around, and someone else, can probably help
: well, VLC used to be able to play these movies in previous ubuntu releases.  : but not anymore
are there any error messages?
: yes.  : [00000361] pulse audio output error: Failed to connect to server: Connection refused \n [00000361] pulse audio output error: Pulse initialization failed \n X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
ok, seems it's having sound problems.. try this "pkill -9 pulseaudio; pulseaudio -D".  then try the movie again
: so restart the daemon ... ok. Done that: same result.
does sound work with other movies?
I have the ubuntu 11.04 server install can't find /media/cdrom issue
during the install it can't find /media/cdrom ?
yeah need to ln -s /cdrom /media/cdrom
don't think you do
it's a known bug
under what circumstacnces
[URL]
if it's a known bug can you give me the bug id.  perfect, thank you.  just alt F2/F3 keys to get a terminal
during the install?
pretty much as soon as the kernel has booted for the installer
cheers i'll try it
that should be enough time to get a terminal
looks all good - thanks for the help
nice job
it seems to work sometimes. but when i supply a directory whose name contains spaces, it just echos each piece of directory path, delimited by the spaces.
quote the $THE_DIR
ok, shoul i just do "apt-get install gstreamer" ?
sudo apt-get install gstreamer*

Do you have a livecd or the alt cd
Did it work?
Redsocrates: dunno yet, gotta reload alsa
why doesn't apt-get work?\
its not in the repos
- that's cool and all, but what do I do?
follow the link i gave you, read
so anything like logitech, MS should be usable?
Yes this should be fine - go the forums though just to check if any particular models have given trouble.
cheers

what about speed ?
na I'm running 2.0.0.1. is 3.0 good?
just read they use new gecko 2.0 which is speedimproved alot ..
epiphany uses gecko I think
(all alpha state!).  but not gecko 2.0
just to start lighttpd at boot
ah lightppd, oversaw that, can ad it to rc.local. add*.  /etc/rc.local is executed last at bootup and commands in there run with root privilegs, so just start the service there
no I want to rename the device.  I have 3 cards... 2 are the same
you can rename the /dev node if you like. I'm not sure why you want to, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.
and I have problem in mixer, I belive that is the cards names that is the sabe.  the same
usually the mixer will work with a symlink.  do you know what name the mixer is using?
but the problem is card:0 (Ensoniq PCI), card:1 (Ensoniq PCI)
it isn't true that two instances of a piece of hardware have the same name..  that's usually not the name that matters.  usually the important name is /dev/XXXX
oh..
(as the trasnitio wasn't donne until this cycle and now the default is 3.6). (in 17.10)
I ran into problems with what I thought was my hard drive. Since running fsck it's become so screwed.
could it be that the hard drive was failing and that was why you were running fsck in the first place?
makes sense  :D
or in synaptic ... right click the package and "mark for reinstallation" or whatever it says.
: ya.  : any idea ??
what is the output of: lsb_release -c
i did and my video now has to run in low graphic mode
do you mean the window effects?
which would mean the harddrive is bad?
Possibly. Can you boot a liveCD ?.  You can use the live CD to check and possibly repair
which would be odd, because yes, I can boot up to the live cd. I can assemble the software raid groups based on those drives. I can scan for logical volumes, and mount them successfully.
Perhaps it's just having trouble finding the correct hdds. I have never set up a raid but I know they are usually problematic
not sure how I should repair :-/ Not exactly sure what went wrong. I'm tempted to just try to re-install but keep existing partitions/volumes/raid groups.  first time in many years that I've had problem out of raid...not even sure raid is the issue here ;-)
Boot the liveCd and look at the drives in gparted. gparted will show errors in the list of partitions..  I'm not really sure raid is the issue either
:). I'm using i7 processor
me too lol

!info bluez.  type sudo apt-get install bluez
I did that already but it tells me that I already have latest package. But I want to downgrade it to 4.101 as the latest one 5.30 messes with my bloothooth card
how did you install the latest one? a ppa?
yes
!ppa-purge
thanks
np
how it is then ?
you can get a list of installed packages, and install them on the new machine, as for your settings, you can copy your /home directory.  interested?.  another way to do it would be to dd the installation
yeah
how about power management for you?
I have a toshiba so all I had to do was add toshiba and toshiba_acpi to the modules file. it's good
saw something about laptop-detect in ubuntu install...
. thnks

yeah, im in there.  how do you disable a key?

I thought I have XGL and Beryl running. It rusn fantastic. I wanted to build a cheap, ubnuntu friendly computer. Does anyone know a good, cheap wireless card that works with Dapper out of the box. i.e. no driver required. NOx, I would do this. apt-get remove xserver-xorg. then delete. then. apt-get install xserver-xorg. and configure it from scratch
what on earth is the point of that?
To fix his Xserver problem. It worekd for me
why not just dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
applications take forever to open, still waiting on system monitor... i was editing a spread sheet in libre and there is serious lag like when i click a cell to edit it. right now system monitor shows almost no cpu load. when i opened firefox compiz jumped to 18%
perhaps it is a GPU-based issue. Anything interesting from the dmesg command in a terminal. Maybe the kernel has something to say.
just times it on my cell phone stop watch from clicking on rhythmbox in the doc to application opening was exactly 27.15 seconds. thats insane right?!.  ^
i have a noticeable lag using the Gnome desktop after a while or after waking from sleep, gnome_shell process seems to have a problem for me..  yes, that is definitely a problem... unless you are running a P4 with 512MB of RAM... which I am guess you are not. :)
ok looks like im getting some errors. [URL]  any ideas on what i should do?
was just looking up Macbook Pro and 13.10
oh sry to nag
no worries, I am sure you are eager to get it going. Looks like the Ubuntu Macbook Pro community page is not updated for 13.10 yet.
:/. should i go back to 13.04. ?
If 13.04 works for it, then I would if I were you. I have not experienced enough of a difference in 13.10 to make it worth any migration trouble.
i was getting the same lag on 13.04. but i didnt test it 4 long. the goal was to go to 13.10 from the start and i thought maybe the issue would get resolved in the upgrade
ahh I see. Usually Ubuntu comes out of the gate pretty snappy feeling.
the last line of dmesg was: Warning: nss-myhostname is not installed. Changing the local hostname might make it unresolveable. Please install nss-myhostname!. should i try a sudo apt-get install nss-hostname. ?
there is no such package by that name
lol idk. im an uber noob
I guess I would be surprised if that was the culprit, anyway. Other have had that message without issues. But I do not know anything about it beyond that.
ok
no worries... you have it running on a Mac, so that is something... at least it was an accomplishment the last time I installed it on a Mac.
any ideas about this error: ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address
off the cuff, I am going to guess it is a graphics driver issue.
yeah im think ur right
my off the cuff message was an overal thought, not in reference to that last message you sent.
which is weird bc my card is supported and there is a proprietary driver
it looks like people have had to work to get some things working on a Macbook pro for wireless.
oh I already configured that but I still don't any internet connection
/etc/init.d/networking restart
did that too
if that doesn't do it then you've something wrong.
and nothing
mess around with networking in gnome. try to see if you have connectivity on another box etc.. start investigating...
Hi Quixoton I now have the notification sounds in empathy. but yet no bootup sounds
good then
Does on 12.04 have any sounds like when u empty the trash etc?
never experienced that before, i just shift+delete all the time :d
This is my dad's laptop n he wants want. Bootup sound still missing ;(. Can any1 help me to get boot up sounds on 12.04?
seems that it's been disabled by default version after update.  a minute, i'm looking for a remedy.. :)

did you try purging it and reinstalling it...?
tried that no go
: show us the output of iwconfig, ifconfig
yes i have run the command and it is created. Next i do?
sudo apt-get update. then either do the updates in the update manager or type: sudo apt-get install libreoffice
it's a command I took from a book. There is said that +0 appears twice because the identical lines may not be adjacent. But what does the one thing have to do with the other?
well, that syntax isn't valid for "modern" sort versions.  I suspect the book is either a.) old b.) for a unix OS that use an older/custom sort binary
thank you
it's outdated but zhould work.. should*
you mean like fglrx?
yea if u use ati
yep
then thats the one.  in the synaptic look in the fglrx package properties you'll pbbly see libGL file there
fglrx-kernel-2.6.26.3_8-7-[URL]b.  will dpkg -i do the trick?
nope u have to purge and its not fglrx-kernel package its another one.  xorg-driver-fglrx
so apt-get --reinstall install xorg-driver-fglrx? >>
dont reinstall just yet cause im not sure that libGL belongs to that package look it up in synaptic properties->installed files

and very likely to break your ntfs parition
no, it doesn't turn on at all,
did you remember to plug it back in?
isnt there a command?
export VAR=value sets it temporarily.  And only for programs spawned by that shell
i have not changed my [URL]st at all
if you do apt-cache showpkg <program> does the version of the program you want appear in the list of known versions?
no, it does not, in fact i se no versionnumber at all.  oh.. wait...  no.. it only shows the current verion and i want an older
I can't recommend an older binary for most situations, but there's two ways to install one.  if you're familiar with compiling from source that would be a 3rd way that would likely have better results
I did, but it doesn't send a message to the users desktop that the system is being rebooted..  If the user has a console open, they will see the message, but if they don't, I want a dialog box to open up on the users desktop notifying them that they need to save work.

well first, noobs are a very arrogant presumptous bunch overall. especially the windows users. almost all of them come with a whole pile of baggage. which is usually labeled 'the customer is right, therefore even if i am completelly wrong i will stillinsist that i am right"

no one seems to like to talk in #grub
searched on the ubuntu forums any?

I won't be of much help then.. but at least you have confirmed that people can read what I post.. How do I change suspend hooks? Specifically, I need to run a script after resuming from suspend.
how do i do it automatically. automatically as in every time i plugin the usb drive
Add this to /etc/fstab: UUID=your_drives_uuid /mnt vfat defaults,umask=0000 0 0.  To find the UUID, "sudo blkid".  I also suggest creating a directory like /media/usb and using that instead of /mnt, but that's up to you.

th ip doesn't load?
it doesn't.
well you not connected to the internet. can you see your router (use routers ip)
but, if I load a browser inside of a *game*, it loads it
a game?
it took me to google
can you ping [URL]. what game?. the ip took you to google?
how do I achieve it?
it depends on your router. However for mine I go into its DHCP settings and it has an option to reserve IPs for certain card MAC addresses

Because I'm using unity, I have libreoffice
did you do a clean install or a distro upgrade?
no
How did you install your Flash

other than skype... Well... Emulation is out of the question, right? (Wine)
There is no interface called wlan0.. The wireless interface name is eth1
you need to install your wireless driver before
Upon first boot, Unbuntu told me that there is a Broadcom driver available and I selected to install it and it did.
Manoj: sure, have you tried to install third-party drivers ?
I have not. I had similar trouble with third party drivers on SuSE so I switched to Ubuntu. Which third party driver would you recommend?
private messaging you
ok I had a friend fix it the other day for me, but i messed up my install trying to fix grub after a xp reinstall
you remember where / how he did it? even remotely
if I don't get it fixed here now when he come over again today I can email the fix to you.  no I was not there when he fixed I was working on a dead laptop trying ti fix
if you want you can /msg it, im 99% of the time online :)
that shouldn't be a problem
thanx in advance, should i figure it out in the meantime i'll let you know
I know he said it was easy to fix he just switch the output somewhere but i don't know where.  what laptop you have if you have a laptop that is
a desktop, 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)
I just installed mythbuntu, hoping to dual boot with XP. But for some reason when I boot from the hdd and it gets time to load a OS, and hopefully show me the boot menu, the screen just fills up with "grub" over and over again
if you can, get a ubuntu live cd and boot it. and try an install to see if that helps
I'm in the live cd right now
oh. ok. um, download the ubuntu iso and burn it.  how did you install?
Well the CD I booted into is the Mythbuntu Live CD / Install CD
hmm
I just went through the install normally....didn't select anything but default settings
try reinstalling. that usually helps me. what burn speed did you use?. always use the lowest speed on things like this
I burnt it in 16X
was that the lowest?
I think it's just something wrong with how the dual loader is setup or something, I can't really say since I'm new at this stuff
always get comfortable with the live cd first.  try uninstalling mythbuntu first and see if that helps.  uninstalling mythbuntu will remove grub, letting you boot xp
yes I am
what card are you on and what step are you on?
those are both true. it's too bad.
dotjay: the "unrar" command installed by package unrar in Multiverse supports rar 3.0 specs and encryption to the best of my knowledge...

from where
yeah 1 sec.  [URL]
so you've put that kernel on a 12.04 box ?
yeah
so you've put that kernel on a 12.04 box ?
works nice
why ?.  why have you done that ?
because its newer.. why not?
then you should know what you're doing if you're taking that approach
really? its not hard to just install the .deb, it just worked.. if not I would have rolled back using grub and removed it
honestly, why change a working kernel thats fully supported, meets dependencies and is part of your branch to an unreleased unpatched kernel for no reason
I don't see the issue
then get on with fixing your problem
happyfool yay. happyfool there is a init-function file inside
great.  ok, now we're going to enable write access on your partition.  and then copy this file over

nope. the other computer can ping me. just can't access my shares
sftp :)
i wanna see if it tells him its already there :(
problem is, I cant remember if the install put the CD/DVD as a source in '/etc/apt/[URL]st'
trust xubuntu. i have two types of file manager
whats "trust ubuntu"?
im running lxde on xubuntu 14.04. the program that have this problem is thunar. pcmanfm runs with no problem
So what happens when you start thunar?

be safe, have fun
not sure what "time fix" you are thinking of, but I already rebooted like 5 times to no avail ;)
"Superblock last mount time is in the future. Fix? yes" <--- from your paste.  is your date/time correct?
no, the time wasn't correct - it's correct in the installed Kubuntu but in the LiveCD it showed up as 4 hours earlier. Adjusted it now, but do you think this was the problem?.  anyway, I'll try again now
are you able to enter failsafe/recovery mode in ubuntu and run a fsck on that partition/disk?.  yeah, if the time difference is to big you will get complaints.
i want to be ablle to access network btu with subnet
thats easy, you will need to configure your LAN to NOT use DHCP and just static what ever ip space it has
example wlan0 192.168.1.1 (internet) eth0 10.0.0.1 with access to 10.0.*.1..... or access to 10.*.*.*
and setup what ever routes are needed
Any idea what might be causing it?
I mean.. the text in the list of mails.. not the folder view or the mail content view
yes, it's not all fonts - just some. Bold ones look the worst
I think it looks the same here.. although I've never had as many unread mails as you have there so I haven't noticed
Dr willis > hey how comes it on my Compizfusion box the F terminals r brok after I boot up and log in?
most likely its the framebuffer fighting with the X server..  as a test. disable the framebuffer. I think the framebuffer wiki ubuntu page has info on that.
oooooooo OK so kill that framebufer in the card setup OK kewl
i disable the framebuffer from the grub menu.lst file.  Not siure what/where you are refering to.
Thank you loads.
I just googled microphone +ubuntu first couple links
i will do that right now i had mythtv installed
I have only ever used tvtime.. with varying success. unfortunately I no longer have a tv card so I cant help you further
yes (ubuntu studio). i tried to remake the iso (mkisofs -r -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/[URL]t -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table)
I don't know how to use a boot cd on a make. you put it in the slot and reboot?
oh right, the auto complete isnt doing anything though haha
becuase it doesn't exist?
if thats the case, if I'm trying to report a wireless bug, what would I use in the entry? I never understood that process. I always found it easier to just post, like a forum
sorry I'm not sure - it's "ubuntu-bug PACKAGENAME" but I'm not sure where a wireless bug would go, sorry.
just use synaptic to get rid of that plugin?
yes if you already have mplayer installed it will need to be reinstalled.  mozilla-mplayer that is
i dont know because [URL]nf nolonger contains that information
hrm. are you able to get back to X via f7 or f8?
f7.  yes by f7
ok - check your System->Administration->Hardware drivers
it says no proprietar drivers are in use on this system... other than that its blank
odd... have you tried booting without the 'quiet splash' options set?
those are set by default. i tried removing then and have the same issue
ok
actually i removed the quiet option and changed splash to nosplash
that's just fine :)
out of ideas?
still looking..
ok thanks :)
is this jaunty?
yes upgraded.... i had the same issue before i upgraded though
k
not sure. Let me look. Yes :/. Not gonna work?
you need package perl-suid, then.  the hardy package says something about it being deprecated, but the intrepid package doesn't, so it appears to be undeprecated
Thanks a million,
you're welcome :)
I tried this. There is no difference.
wait please just checking something
I can, it gives Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
ok, so then lsb_release is not crashing
but it keeps saying it is crashing everyday and report bugs and report bugs about apport and lsb_release and I think bugs are actually not reported
what says it's crashing ?.  what's actually happening
I just started ubuntu-bug to report it manually and .. it popped as bug report.
report what manually ?
"sorry, the application lsb_release has closed unexpectedly". using ubuntu-bug ?
so that just randomly pop's up
it starts reporting keyboard addon bug, then apport itself then after 6 or so bug reports it quits. now it popps up apport-gtk bug report
slow down
It is like that since the first day of install
so your system is running fine, then you get a popup saying lsb_release has closed unexpectedly
ok
is my summary correct ?
, it first pops up like application crash, then apport-gtk crash and then lsb_release crash
you're not making sense
now reports /usr/lib/command-not found
you system is running fine - then you get a warning that lsb_release has crashed, correct ?
this is my second instalaltion on second HDD. Since the moment of update from 12.04 to 12.04.2 it pops up bugs and I think apport is unable to report them automatically.
please stop giving me information I'm not asking for and answer the question I AM asking
no, system running fine, and he pops up showing many crash bug reports once a day
right, ok, so there is a bigger problem here then
i know about that. However i have two disks and i need to figure out where my windows partition is for GRUB.
sudo fdisk -l
that returns info in hdb2.  It does not return where the NTFS partition is.
fdisk -l should list every partition on all fixed drives; one of them should be marked as ntfs or vfat on the right
i started up GParted. That says its hdb1
then it would be hd(1,0)
so i take it its (hd1,0)
erm,  :)
yeah... That's what it says in my GRUB startup. But it just displays a bunch of random characters..  The whole problem may have been that i had the ( right before the hd instead of next to the 1.
no, you wer right, that's what the erm was ;)
well shit. That means it doesn't work right.
does your grub stanza look similar to http://paste.ubuntu-[URL] ?
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1307:0163 Transcend Information, Inc. 512MB/1GB Flash Drive. , given from lsusb
sudo fdisk -l >> /dev/sdb1 or such
I get the error permision not granted ,, it dosent even ask me for my root pass
sudo fdisk -l (l is lower L)
that waht i've typed
isn't your regular user in the sudoers file ?
just like normal lspci, or lsusb?. ls alone will work as a dir?
no, lspci is a program to list pci devices. ls is a program to list directory contents / files (hence ls - short for list)
Wow, With colors and all! Thansk for the help dude! Take care
also look at ls -al
Will do the ls -help and check them all out
also man ls. :)
How long should this take?
It should be almost instant . Now ifconfig
Still hasn't returned to command prompt.
can you open another terminal and look at dmesg
Hundreds of lines about forcedeth.
can you be a little clearer
dunno actually. don't have the problem _right now_. i shall make a note of checking that next time (any audio file from any random podcast played with the totem plugin will do, right?)
yeah
Because I didn't know any better at the time; I was seeking a light-weight easy-to-use distro. This system is circa 2002..  I may indeed switch the window manager to gnome at this point, though.
ok wel if you wanted to try Gnome you can follow instructions on this page for removing xubuntu and installing Gnome [URL]
slart: why does it ask for it then?
it doesn't know what drivers you are using.. you've installed the drivers manually, right?
slart: i used recovery console to install 180.22 from [URL]
yup.. then the restricted drivers manager doesn't know that you already have drivers that work...  just ignore it
slart: i would think that it would ask to install nvidia-glx-96, nvidia-glx-173, and nvidia-glx-177, but it just says "nvidia
it will probably chose one of those
but are they included by default.
that's a distro issue. Ubuntu inherits some of Debian's DFSG. which are good for Linux in general, just potentially problematic for end users
i don't get that option, just a message saying there is no association with that type of link
perhaps go to edit>preferences and see if you can set the filetype
it's my DSL router (fritzbox). and for all other devices its reliable
what host are you trying to resolve
doesnt matter, cant resolv a single one
what hosts are you trying to resolve
doing dig [URL] @<my router ip> works
ok, so you know the router is working, how do you know yoru ubuntu box is using the router
I dont.. How do I check this?. "ip route show"?
no.  that shows routes
tracert?
no, that traces routes
:D. okay, enlighten me
are you using network manager to configure your host
no. I.. dont configured anything
right, so it's network manager configuring your network
It's just connected to an AP via ethernet
this is a desktop install right ?
the AP is connected to my router.  lubuntu + i3 without gnome
what is in /etc/[URL]nf
deufral what changes do I need to make in that file so it gets the right ip from the right dns server?
and see if the 'request' section contains 'domain-name-servers'
it does have a section that contains that info but it does not specify an specific hostname nor Ip address
then your DHCP server should provide it's configured DNS server(s) IP address(es)
that might be an issue on the server end
maybe, but my friend's got it working finer. fine*
have you turned off all your firewalls or set up correct port forwarding?
how?.  do you think this thing needs to be pf'd?
2GB.  maybe I have to uninstall KDE and use xfce?.  Gnome was the same
It shouldnt be noticibly slower by any means.. I would look closely about things you added after the initial install
Aeon-I want to uninstall the enviroment itself
so the UI?
Yeah VirtualBox. I installed guest additions and all the updates.
that's normal. when you virtualize a computer like that, it shares resources with the main computer. you might be able to fine tune VirtualBox, but that is beyond the scope that can be offered here
I'm in there right now, but can't figure out what's wrong and that guy is on a mac/OSX machine.  got an installation issue...
ah.
hoary is supposed to be pretty much the same on the live. oh ok. that makes sense
livecds are pretty tight on available space
gotcha, thanks
np
exact same problem l00pback.
?. more on that please
ty
yw
cool stuff, i could saw at once that no merging is required, just a replace
yep, meld is nice
thanks !
np :)
which repo can I use ?.  will firefox recognize HeliPlayer once it's installed ?
no you need to restart firefox
how do I tell firefox that a .rmm extension must be read with HelixPlayer ?.  I did, but clicking on a .rmm link doesn't do anything special. Should it ?
i think this will help you out [URL]
so that locate looks inside files?
no, locale just finds files
To ALSA, the Live /is/ Slot-0, as I manually set that up through modprobe.d rules in alsa-base..  But, PulseAudio doesn't seem to care. LOL
Are you using /etc/pulse/[URL] ?
I had tried to figure out what to do with that..
One of the example configurations has a line "add-autoload-source input module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0 source_name=input" Looks like the type of thing that you want.  Though obviously not for source, that does specify a specific alsa device
ah, so I couldn't just hand things over to bash after x starts to ensure things work for users?
I'm not sure if bash can do everything dash does.. any special reason you want to replace dash?
my thinking was that if they were nicely compatible, then the only negative upshot would be an impreceptible speed difference if they restarted stuff, etc
dash is used just because it's a lot lighter than bash.. so replacing dash with bash will probably slow your computer down
yes, I was rather hoping I could hand over to bash after init had started the machines. and it's more than one machine
but why not give it a try.. rename dash and create a shortcut that's called dash but pointing to bash.  then try rebooting.. but have a live cd ready if things don't work out
I'm completely happy to have it used during startup since that offers an advantage. but the incompatibility with shell scripts doesn't really give users any advantage
or even better.. try it in a vm
aside from the pleasure of being admonished for expecting things to work as bash - and I don't feel committed to arguing with them about that :)
=)
i know but its a question i don't know the answer to and its for Ubuntu
as such, some have success; you may wish to talk the makers (they generally are on [URL] forum or #eeepc )
i have an msi netbook, its an atom processor so i'm assuming it will work the same
better to ask in the appropriate channel for support
What I want to do is make a script to execute an emulator from the Terminal
got the path to the emulator? or was it installed as a package?.  you can write a bash script to do that.  assuming you really do want to run it from the terminal..  can I /query you?
thor: i have no idea how to do this lol, i'm new to linux
when you reboot you will see a 3 second countdown. Press ESC during that 3 seconds and you will get a menu of the installed kernels. I suspect you are using the highest number (2.6.28-15) which has just recently come out. See if you have 2.6.28-13, and if so boot into that. Any number lower than -15 (or whatever you are using) is worth a try
this makes a lot of sense, i did a system upgrade earlier and that's when the wireless stopped
also, unless you have used wicd before I would suggest reinstalling network manager....solve one problem at a time
?
if you run: sudo lshw -C display do you see an Intel GPU and an Nvidia GPU?
where there any tricks? i have it where the other user (using gmail web video client) can't see me, but can hear me and i can see AND hear them
just enable the plugin, it all works after that
what plugin?
the Video and webcam plugin
voice/video settings plugin?
yup
did you change the settings from default?
nope
pidgin from the distro or from [URL]
not distro is called the repos. its*
uh, yeah. hmm. let me roll back and see
Alright
verbatim ?
yes without the '
how do I go about doing that?
the host keys it should do itself - if you have any keys in ~/.ssh just delete them and regenerate them as usual.  assuming you upgraded your packages from [URL]
i didnt tried cuz i dont have :)
well, the install CD is also a liveCD
i know.. but i have only 6.06 install cd.
so how did you install 8.10 ?
Yup
Have you checked the CD for defects?
i haven't gotten anywhere
Linux is a unix and u learned a lot of unix today.
are you sure? how do you know?
I have it ;)
thanks!!.  any catch? or does it Just Work since upgrading?
upgrade on my T61 went fine
thanks - was there any kind of notification, or has Compiz been activated automatically
hmm can't remember, but just go to system > prefs > appearance and check.  it probably was
Yes
Find it in the menus, then right click on it, and chose which option you want.
Whenever I rightclick on a program it just opens it.
Are you sure you're right clicking and not left clicking?
[URL] is where i am at right now
Do you know you want to customise a livecd? Or do you want to customise a system that's already installed?
live cd
ahh I haven't done that for a while. I vaguely remember a tool called ubuntu-builder but I don't know if it is up-to-date.  Looks like Ubuntu Customisation Kit is the new hotness, and has replaced ubuntu-builder. That Wiki link you already posted will serve you well
I done that. It doesen't work.
thats all i know.  i use ssh, does everything
dmesg says nothing at all and if I connect to the process with "strace -p <pid>", I get "strace: Process 14411 attached" and then strace also hangs forever
strace /sbin/mdadm --examine --scan --config=partitions
is it safe to run another one while the first is hung?
I wouldn't
@ should i only have one primary partition and the rest logical?
that's a reasonable thing to do.
but someone told me to get that. oh DUH. jeeze...sorry lol
:)
Failed to download. it downloaded all the rest
try another mirror :)
address?. :). please (sorry, bad manners)
They can be found at backports/[URL]
thanks
never was. unless you gpg-encrypt all :). quite (unless I missed a bit). it's a debugger. If you don't know how to use it and have no imminent need to: don't try it. it's horrible to use
-d shows 10.10 as option, however i was hopeing to go from 10.04 lts to 10.04.1 lts.  thanks mate, your tip led me in the right direction!
just update ua software packages. it will automatically upgrade to 10.04.1
all figured out now, thanks alot!
lol.. welcome
that doensnt show the connection speed
let me websearch.  try iftop
its not installed, will try though
[URL]
huphenated , and run minicom ?
yeah, but you probably need to tell minicom to use /dev/ttyUSB0 or something.  after plugging it in, the last few lines of "dmesg" will say exactly which device to use
I run this desklet from the gDesklets application so what should I put in the startup list pleasE?
i don't know, never used gDesklets..is there an option in gDesklets configuration to run @ system startup maybe?
Thank you. :)
you're welcome
yup. hard to. launching from console doesn't show anything
have you upgraded synaptic to the version in hoary too?
and what are the supported ubuntu desktops? (without being Unity2d
!info prosody.  the ones in the ubuntu repos.
llutz, thank u save me reading the manual :)
-A(fter) -B(efore) -C(before+after). !info alien
k. go to terminal. and type in lspci. you shold see it there
oh thanks very much, ill get right on with it ~:)
im pretty new to linux, i assume you mean run that as sudo?
Try running sudo gdm instead
it gave me a warning. that i wasnt quick enough to catch. unable to...
did it start though?
ill try again. nope. same blank screen
okay,. do you have proprietary drivers or open source drivers?
probably proprietary. i was running windows 7
if you don't know then you have opensource drivers. you need to manually set the proprietary drivers. install*. on the command line try the following: sudo nano ~/.xinitrc. and tell me if there's anything in that file
.ogg files with video
ahh. i think totem does them, and xine and mplayer for sure
nope
what are you trying to connect?
a webcam. ANother cam worked right away, this one does not
you installed V4L ?
how do I do that? doesn't it come with xawtv?
i have no idea - install libpt-plugins-v4l2
I have v4l2 installed along with v4l-conf. however not v4l (but v4l2 is anewer version from what I can tell)
what type of a webcam you are trying to connect, and to which port?
USB port, it's a gpt/chicony dc-2120
please give me the output of the command: "ls /dev | grep video".  when the webcam is connected ofcourse.
video0 and video (1349)
ok, now do that: "sudo cat /dev/video0" and move something that the cam can see. do you see any change on the screen?
i get: "cat: /dev/video0: Function not implemented"
try the same thing with /dev/video
1 second let me find my screenshot
rgr
[URL] running 6.06 LTS
i doubt its gnome settings daemon. when did you restart last. have you tried restarting x
oh ok how do I change that atrowork?
see if this link helps you: [URL]
thanks - if the download times out will it resume if I use the same command again?
yup
It's really nice
yeah, I like it
U new to LaTeX or expert ;)
new
yea I have both loaded. bluetooth 46340 7 hci_usb,rfcomm,l2cap
and "hcitool dev" shows nothing?
that's the option from contorl right?.  i'll check
in most UEFI set-ups, its a boot option
i've turned off fast startup. but i'm not sure about quick boot.  should I enter the BIOS?
Good... that's the same thing just different names I think..  when the system starts, are you pressing the system's alternate boot menu key, so you can choose which device to boot?
f11 yes. but none of them show the sandisk usb as an option. i've also done what was recommended by a few forums. and changing the boot priorities. the three types of usb (cd, hdd, or key). none of them seem to trigger
OK, for the USB, you might see two entries, one will begin something like "EFI: ... USB ..." the other maybe "ATA: ... USB...." ... you're choosing the "EFI:" entry?
the usb.  i'll be right back
ok
splitvt splits any terminal into upper and lower terminals.  splitvt is like quadkonsole but without the need for <puke> KDE
So it's kinda like your version of screen?
well, for example if I have multiple things I want to be seeing at once without toggling screen for, I can load them up in stacked areas of a terminal
how about a screenshot?
hmm, I don't have one handy.  its just a boring image of two terminals in one anyway
ever used Clive to download videos?. "dban" ??. oh!!!
[URL]  boring, but helpful tool
Those are the ones that do the best work ! :)
Just tun it?
add in keysyms, basically
It seems that when I try and bind the keys in XFCE, they are all being read as the same key...
you sure you have the right Keysyms?. I'm not sure how you bind keys in XFce, actually, I was talking about a global X bind
xev to find them and direct copy and paste from /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
Dreadshoot: yeah, that's global X, i'm pretty sure. errr. damned tab-complete!.  sorry
so it seems that .xsession isn't being called at startup ?!? odd -- I manually ran the xmodmap command using my Xmodmap file and they work now
not sure why.... *shrugs*
hehe - the fish dies on this page. code 157 :P. i'm out of luck today :(
wow.
"sudo apt-get --reinstall install gnome*" wants to install everything with gnome in it.  oh cool, i'll try that
--reinstall ubuntu-desktop maybe never tried before
yes, I'm stuck with this retarded wvdial config
wrong place si far with the info provided. ;). so*.  So what is the end goal here? The stick not working?
yep. It's an embedded device, and I've been fighting for hours to get the hardware to respond (had to break out the soldering iro acutally).
This I can tell is beyond me, hope you get it working. ;)
[URL]
cheap usb wif sticks all over I would just do that.. wifi*
lol. I'd love to. kinda hard when it's in a vehical heading down the highway at 60MPH
Hit the next truck stop and make some new friends and pick up a stick.. ;)
lol, they're going to be rolled out to a large number of trucks. it's a tracking system
ah, big brother truckin stylew. style
yea. lazy truckers
his*
why do I hear gears grinding?
I'm a noob
already popped that window, I accepted.  and it's been stuck for a good 20 minutes
hmm, that's not right.  if you're really sure it has stopped, cancel the install, stop the software center and install wine from a terminal to see what happens
Yea,
get an SMP kernel which should be default in edgy and feisty i believe
I found a couple..I wanted to try to compile an SMP..HAving trouble with the headers
what ubuntu are you using?
I did that. seems to be fine
what error it brings?
dmesg has nothing related to it.  Where else?
try out /var/log/messages, that's normally a good place to start. Otherwise, check the other logs in /var/log/
Nothing.  No pulse related entries
have you read the pulse init.d script to see if there's anything in there you're meant to be setting up?
I don't see anything, but I'm not the most informed shell scripter. Do you have hardy?
as it happens, I do..  but I'm running server; it's pulseaudio, you say?
Aye.  It's odd, I get no errors, but it just doesn't start. It's not in my running process list, and nothing can connect to it
pretty common for a misconfigured daemon. It takes time to get used to them..  have you tried pulseaudio -D ?
It's running now, but still not accepting connections
That's all the init.d script calls; read the options from man pulseaudio and also read the script again in start-stop-daemon line in pulseaudio to see how the maintainers are using it.
Hrm, nevermind it was just that app
so you're doing a little better now?
im still dist-upgrading. maybe it is fixed after that.
running stuff in the middle of a upgrade is often not a good idea. :)
i dont want no fu command line utility...
what was that?
i want a gui tool that shows youtube stuff but without streamung directly
I mean what is fu command line
like quicktime player or mplayer-plugin or the youtube flash player. damn command line
watch the language
that is where it is typically.
if they weren't, where would i configure gdm to recognize them?
IIIEars: busy channel..  they are there.
okay, thanks
That would rock.
there is quite a lot of people working on it
yes,
I believe it stores them in a plain text file -- can't remember the exact path as I don't have access to my server from the house.
i have the path... /var/log.....somthign
it should be in your conf file the exact path to it.
i was under the impression that that was an automatic firmware loader, and that it automatically got the firmware from the os x partition
I am afraid not, isight works perfectly under ubunty 7.10, follow the instructions and you will have it
alright, thanks for the advice though I have done this tutorial before without success but i will try again
no problem, good luck!
but wheres the link?
you give it the regular url and youtube-dl gives you the direct link (and downloads it for you)
let me try.  hey setting of youtube dl is done. now where and how to get the link?
youtube-dl --help
how? the install process just ended..  and Feisty doesnt boot
did the install complete?
there's no package called similar to that
have you multiverse repository activated?
sure not :)
why not?.  msttcorefonts pack is there
- anywhere. disk utility, finder.  - [URL]
disk utility?. archive manager in ubuntu will mount it.  a google search means nopthing you need to detail what you want and the final goal here.
- that's nice, but i am trying to install ubuntu
HOw?
- by downloading an iso, burning or mounting it, and running the installer
Ah, cool never ran a apple myself, someone might know.
it's on the installed os
floppy drive 0
no floppy. is that what it's complaining about there?
What errors.. and is this off livecd of ubuntu or gparted live or installed os.  yes fd0 floppy drive 0
unable to open /dev/fd0 read-write (read only file system). Input/output error during read on /dev/fd0. Can't have overlapping partitions. I am running gparted from installed os.. ok, and what about the "can't have overlapping partitions". i think that sounds... well, bad.
do you have a floppy in the drive.
no :(
is it a laptop? Is there a switch to turn the wifi off and on?
yes the light can be switched on and off, but it change the OS detecting the wireless card. It worked before an upgrade today..  excuse me, "doesn't change the OS detecting ..."
boot the system with the switch on. may help
How do I lock in refresh rates on two monitors?
you mean same rate on both?
Is that really 'that' offensive?..
this is a family friendly channel. if you can't/won't comply with that community expectation, I suggest you seek support elsewhere.
(For me, that is)
ah. well, nvidia does a decent job with their drivers currently. it's gonna suck if/when they ever start dropping support.. actually, i wonder what the level of support is for vdpau in the OSS driver
I just searched with aptitude and that is what it listed....  early..shoulda been looking at that for sure
you sure it wasn't 2.6.26. 7. 27
What the heck...it definitely is using 2.4...and it doesn't find 2.6 when searching with aptitude...
show me the output of uname -a
it was worth a shot... flashcam is giving me sucha headache with it's "unsupported format" message
Adobe Flash for Linux closed source, but at the moment the best for Flash
i've got the latest flash from adobe, but without flashcam, flash sites don't find the camera, and with flashcam it only finds the input not the output,
what's Flash cam?
that directory doesn't seem to be there.
grep -i documentroot /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default. DocumentRoot /var/www
gives no suck file or directory... I'm guessing the install failed someplace?
you have a /etc/apache2 directory?
no
does "dpkg -l|grep -i apache" tell you that apache is even installed?
/usr/bin/install: `Command.h' and `./Command.h' are the same file. it crash here
what are you trying to do
not lost just hate reinstalling when things go major wrong.. loose every setting
many of us keep /home on a separate partition, and make backups of /etc.  as well as our /home
OK
can anyone help me with a bluetooth adapter problem..?? anyone know how to do that..?.  where're you from, dude..??
u  ?
i'm from NP.  what 'bout you..?
no but the code was taken from eathena ;)
It creates a few directories, that's all
in what location?.  can you be more specific on how it works?
itfrom the directory you currently are in, it creates obj, and inside obj, it creates common, login, char, map, ladmin and tool
aaah that should due ty! btw this command does not work on windows lol
Yup ;P
hv u use the asteriskgui too?
the web gui?
yes
sure, thats how you configure it
that is where I hv the problem
whats the problem?
is giving me an error: error:Asterisk Call Manager/1.1 Response: Error Message: Missing action in request
what browser are you using?
<> am using firefox 5
Ive seen using the wrong browser causing problems because it requires java to work properly, but I have no idea what that error means
aparently it sucks tho :(
oh, kk, where's that opinion expressed?
My hdd. or secondary Hdd
create a partition with gparted
How would i then copy files to it?.  or do you know of a guide?
Once the partition is created, put a file system on it, then copy like normal.  I'll look for one...
Thank you =]
I won't vouch for this 100%, but it looks OK....  [URL]
thanks , some sites show lines only in some sections, but pictures are fine...
you mean with firefox?
yes
no text, but something like dotted lines?
yes
did you just do an update by any chance?
you mean update ubuntu
yes
it updated last nite....so i saw only 4 updates tonite. yesterday was around 200 or more updates
ok, my first guesses are firefox, and possibly font caching. To repair font caching, run sudo fc-cache --force , log out and back in. check a known bad site
yes, works fin on other distros :P. fine*
Go to System \ Preferences \ Sound and click the System Beep tab.
Hi, no, I tried killing compiz but the shortcut is still there.. I guess there are a million places to define shortcuts in compiz + gnome + xmodmap + .. where else?
try looking in System>Prefs>Keyboard Shortcuts then
does it have support for web cams?
yes. it works with mine, at least
sweet, any speacil one that works out of box?
it depends, but check this page.  [URL]
;). honestly something's wrong if you're worried about the colours of icons
that's so invalids, there's a reason designers care about things like that in all software
although when you say they're black and white, that suggests there is something wrong.  yeah designers, but not users.
we;; I care, I'm a user. well*
them only occasionally having colour does sound a bit like a graphical problem
I can assure you I'm not having any graphical issues.
then how come you have that affect when it's not the norm?
what I'm seeing is perfectly standard behavior. All default icons are in white unity theme, but some apps that I've installed aren't and I'd like to change that.
ok,, thanks
!hardware. also, that .. some extra info
> Do I just type that in?. or is that something I install?
> no go to the compiz-fusion website to get it
ok thankyou
bob801:> please join #ubuntu-us-sc
goof. *good. look.  what version of Ubuntu choice?. ps: my native language is spanish
12.10
yes Kubuntu!
try in #kubuntu ?
its meant to be installed that way though
is it a slackware package?
heh
(don't really do that0
that's jsut for destruction. what do I need to do to upgrade to hoary?
upgrade to hoary, apt-get kde
(link me)
and just start adding programs till it breaks
terminal 'apt-get install firefox' won't work and the ubuntu software center tells me to use the main source and then nothing changes.
how did it get Unisnatlled?
I was using it, and it wouldn't load any webpages for a few hours and i was on xbox playing online with a 4 bar and on an irc channel and there seemed to be no problem, but it wouldn't work so i removed it.
through the software centre or apt-get
so you have a pile of 10'000 external hdds at your place? :D
even better a pile of like ten thousand floppy drives
yea. i want a blank page that will send it to another page
and this is not a ubuntu question. ask in #web or some html channel or whatever
thanks rob
No prob.
i know, can I restore that?. I hear my drive working...... does -R mean every subdirectory is now fucked up?
yeah, that usually toastes an OS
yes
sorry I donno then
well, definitely not running a raid setup - i only have one sata 500 gig drive
gnome-[URL].  What os is on the system now.
Vista
How many partitions...
right now, I have a primary 11.82 GB primary, partition, 420 gig logical partition, 20 gig logical partition, and about 7 gigs of unallocated space. i used to have a 20 gig primary, and 420 and 20 gig logical partitions
No idea why it isnt seeing them.. live cd gets you to a desktop right?
yeh but good luck with that :p. nvidia-settings is the best screen/xorg setup has ever been - i'm so happy with it
It works perfectly fine
i cant use them as it seems that 8.04 doesnt support my card :( so i cant use 3d features :(
tried system>Admin>hardware drivers yet?.  have you tried system>Admin>hardware drivers yet?
No
try it then
when i go there there are no propetatory drivers listed
then i dunno :(
[URL]
yeah somethings listening on port 6082 by the looks
I've got over 60 computers I execute commands on at once
cssh is your friend :p
can you help me with and example
but -t should let you type on those commands, or just use -phigh to force dpkg to default them
you rock.  phigh it is
look at cluster-ssh in the repository too
I've heard of that.  I have passwordless authentication on all my machines.  then I wrote a script that goes out and contacts each machine sequentially
cssh is just a wrapper around ssh, so ud_rsa/dsa will still work.  parallelize that stuff :p
why parallelize?.  thanks for the advice btw
sequential must take forever.  np
I suffix all my commands with the & symbol
okay, ya
you're welcome :)
i wonder if there is a way to send beer through telnet for you =)
lol, Ukranian beer? :)
ok, so you checked my ip address, always new that i should go through some kind of cgi proxy and fyi, ukrainian beer is one of the best beers of the world, have travelled a lot and my friends have too and they confirme it too...
not there.  found it.  thanks
do you have unrar-free installed?
already managed to extract
I'm not sure but I think unrar can conflict with unrar-free if you're using Karchiver or file-roller
yes i have karchiver.  should i uninstall it?
check if you have unrar-free and uninstall it. Then check if you can extract that rar with Karchiver
bash: kill: subversion: arguments must be process or job IDs (when i use kill -9 subversion)
fezK: YOu ned the job ID. fezK: Not the name
:0. and type in mozilla-firefox
ok
i have nothing held back. if i type apt-get install -f. i get a clean 0 0 0 0. nothing removed nothing installed
run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
what if i do that, it doesn't work. and then i cant connect to the internet
just make sure you have the notification thingy
notification thingy?
notification area. add on.  add network monitor if you are worried about getting on the net
so that name determines where it shows up in /dev?
if you want to use a command line I think it's "mtools" for editing ntfs/fat labels...  yes
Huh. That doesn't sound familiar for some reason.
if you give it the label "usbdrive" it will be mounted as /media/usbdrive
route table is empty in both methods
-> are you sure? which command you used to check the route table?
this doesn't inlcude deb-make, which is needed for perl's DPKG::Make
Does dh-make-perl look like the right package?
I mean run windows game with out wine..
ohh, no idea
Well, Hmm
actually no, you need wine
Damn, wine seems to no be working now. I've even been to the wineHQ and they have no clue wtf the problem is.
which version of wine are you using?
1.1.0 Just updated last night when wineHQ told me too.
ahh, k. Can't be of any further help sorry
no commas in between ?
no.  that's what "cp * /to/here" expands to.  "cp <list of files separated by spaces> /to/here" :)
when I copied my files to the new directory, the new directory shows those files with a lock on them ?
The files will generally retain the same permissions. The "lock" indicates that you don't have write permissions. Did you copy from somewhere you didn't have write permissions to (like a CD :))
grub_cmdline_linux_default ?
or run: echo "blacklist i8042" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/[URL]nf > /dev/null.  whichever line has "quiet splash".  add it in the quotes to make "quiet splash i8024.blacklist=1"
k. here we go
remember to run: sudo update-grub to apply
Nope, still present:. [ 2.691481] i8042: PNP: No PS/2 controller found. Probing ports directly.
did you try the [URL]nf file too?
yes, I know...
sach: what are you trying to do specifically?
trying to tweak my desktop panels. eg: add my dictionary app, system monitor graph, etc.
sach: ahh, you'd probably be best off installing gnome-shell and looking for extensions to get things the way you want them
but i'm running from CLI, i'm in the GUI
yes, it works the same way. you are not actually root, but you can become root. for individual commands, just put 'sudo' in front. if you want to be root for a while, do 'sudo -i' to get a root shell..  you'll find that when you 1st enter a sudo command, it asks for your password, but it does keep you authorized for a time, so it's not too cumbersome.
so i can just type sudo to gain root for the whole of the current logged-in session?
'sudo -i' *for that shell session* yes..  in other words, if you open two terminals, you'll do it twice..  it's a simple way of keeping malware from over-writing critical files as a normal user.
yep. Thats the first thing I did
is there /usr/local/src/apache2 in your system? or do you know where apache sources were put?
- yeah i thought so. is there any way to sudo it?
not that I know off
nothing happen!!
continue w/ what u were doing.  what r u trying to do btw?
okay. Karmic's alsa-base is fubar'd.. (I know, +1)
it's a development release, don't expect it to work :P
sweet, is there any documentation for that? I haven't programmed a cisco in like 5 years.
you may need to use /etc/network/interfaces but its definately doable
yai i messed up on typing. Okay. How do i install KDE? I like it better than Gnome :P
try sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
Without installing Kubuntu. lol, id rather have KDE than XFCE :P
or sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
Did not work, keeps giving me random dependencies (Kubuntu-desktop)
random dependencies?
yes
i have had this problem, the way i fixed was that i created an account and shared the password
thanks. will try
i had a config fiel ([URL]nf) that did the trick, the minimal config file doesn't work (i.e. typing the share, writeable guest = ok and public)
_i "guest = ok" where do I put this in [URL]nf
under the share works, outside the share should imply that it work for all the shares.  but the guest = ok keyword doesn't work, maybe we need to change the kind of authentication scheme or something that is used.  wait, let me check
Mine's Hard Drive, is dev/sda2 vital in anyway?
that's probably swap. you need that for hibernate, I believe.
Gah.
you just want a blank partition for macos to put a file syssm on
yes. But the mac OS disk utils won't format things right for some reason
yup, I undersstand that
so how would I go about that? Do you know? :O
I don't know why mac OS isn't writing to the partition.  you may want to ask ##apple or ##macos how to debug mac os.  what model mac is this ?
me neither, it's not coming up. Thanks.  it isn't a mac. :-P
then don't ask it's illegal to run mac os on non-apple hardware
I'm asking how to format an hfs+ partition, nothing more.
I'm telling you not to
no each thread will redirect output with a new filename.
also look into if you can use a mutex lock in the web server's programming langauge
isn't mutex needed when we are writing to the same file?
yeah if you're using a different filename that's fine
ah ok, thank you so much. :)
#wine-hq. ah nevermind
yes but i think it's broken aswell. both packages wont upgrade. <unconvertable>  gnome-desktop-data; nautilus-data; and gnome-system-monitor are all failing to update.
maybe you could try: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
where do I get an md5 for the one from [URL]
should be right there from where you downloaded it, let me get it for you..  here you go: [URL] scroll down and you will see the md5sums. seems like those md5sums would be a little easier to get at.
shadow98: Md5 matches up.  Md5 matches up.  I did "try another linux build" in the usbdrive builder thing... Would that cause a problem?. it installed fine it looks like
hmm, I'm not sure, perhaps running the USB through the build again, if that doesn't work, I"m not sure
here pops up a question. where to put grub on? and regular antswers like: mbr, /, etc...
not sure for a mac, here is a guide (outdated) [URL]
Hello, I did try 2 video card : one nvidia and one ATI.
best bet would be the alternate cd; that works when the livecd chokes
k, I will try. How I can disable the splash screen ? I want to see errors
the boot parameter nosplash and remove quiet
Okay, thanks..  I boot the livecd, press escape and ask for "live nospalsh" and I still get the splash screen at the boot time.
you typed nosplash or nospalsh? and you removed the quiet from the boot param?
Yeah I know about that workaround. I don't want to set the setting each time. No fix?
unfortunately not. But do you have to set these settings each time you log in?.  myself, I found that it sometimes works without problems & sometimes I need the workaround...
mikers: /media /mnt
hmm.. my external fat32 drive just shows up in /media/EXTERNAL when I hook it up (6.10)
How would I do that?
man dpkg
WHat would dpkg do?
dpkg is the backend for apt
- typical tool window for config settings manager in Ubuntu 8.10, I set friction for vobble window style to extremely low value and as a result I got that window away from screen, but it was still open. I was wondering, if there's a chance to get a particular window centered on desktop?
Agent_Al: That is a Compiz or screenlets thing?
- I guess it is Compiz config window
Agent_Al: For most of those affects there is an icon on the taskbar , that lets you configure it, if the icon is gone, then either check to see if it is running...if not , restart the widget
- oh I see, thanks
Agent_Al: Solved?
where?
sorry miss-read your question, I don't have a how to. I just read the deps and build it correctly
its fat16. iirc
so then you want -t fat
no , actually it was working , than i formated it to ext2 ...
after formatting did you "safely remove" or dismount it before unplugging it?.  (unmount, sorry)
i unmounted it before ... than formated it and tried to mount it but not worked.  than restart my system several time , but didnt worked
try reformatting, unplugging, plugging in again... should work
yea it didnt worked either... and moreover , it has badblocks and fsck is not working it says wrong filesystem.  i think it has approx 58 badblocks
try formatting it fat32... that's pretty universal. It may not like ext2
last time there was a separate tab for real player in streamtuner. real media
oh - never seen that
is there a way to make streamtuner search for realmedia stream?. *streams
I have the breezy version - it has a number of tabs but not specifically realplayer.  in short, I don't know
hey what is up Mike
taking care of my wife. She's home sick today.
lucky you
uh, I guess
I would really like to be able to compress the dvd so I can copy the thing, any ideas.  I think I asked you before,didnt I
yeah, is it a data DVD, or a movie?
movie.  uncompressed, 8.5 gig
and you looked at transcode?
not sure exactly how to use it.  you?
I've not used it, really
I tried dvd shrink again, ,keep getting the ASPI error
look into dvdrip
yeah, but it doesnt make the movies copyable to anothre dvd I think
it should...it uses transcode
that is the one that makes it into an .avi right
transcode can convert into several formats
I think that is the one for me, that would not let me compress on the fly
don't know
it's never too late. that place is like a fungus infection
haha
1080p. 70hz
what is 1080p in pixels
1920x1080 I belive
my mbp does that
Nice trying to be cute, but check it out System > Preferences > Sessions > Startup Programs. And then......?
There's a few differences in terminology between the old timers who use linux and the new timers. I've actually never used that menu there!
Apology accepted. So are you able to offer some insight, old-timer?
Heh, other than to look around for some initialization script, perhaps .xinitrc, I don't really have any suggestions..  I /always/ use the console, so I put my stuff in .bashrc. ~/.bashrc, that is.. I have to get going now.. Good luck
just the old ubuntu panels, you could put custom xautomation launchers
The fallback desktop might have that, you mean a launcher correct?
kind of, I want like a floating panel in unity. kind of like a toolbar where if I click a button, it'll type stuff for me
What does "type stuff" mean to you exactly?
link please?
search the wiki for netboot
Does Automatix do anything other than installing packages?
no. it installs them thats it. but you should find most things it does install int synaptic.
Cool, thanks
np
okey, performance well also?
I have 7600gt , and nouveau ran it very well, hardly any diff between it and the nvidia-current driver
okey, that sounds really nice
but I still installed the nvidia-current :)
I reviewed the link you gave me, and I found links to forum posts describing some imaging procedures. I will follow those procedures.
Cool.
router to pc. but I am still getting a nat error
well .. for port forwarding, you'll have to give your box a static IP
oh yeah huh
otherwise it won't be happening, cause everytime the connection is renewed, you'll have a new, dynamically given IP. and after that, just login to your router and have a look
ramirand: Yes, that's right.
Just so I know I have this straight, you're dialed in from somewhere else on computer A, and you connect in to computer B, and you want to run something on computer B that will display on computer B?
Correct again.
Is there a user logged in to computer B?
I can log in. I'm the administrator
That is, someone logged in to the X display.
I can also log in as the current user.  Yes
So there's an X display up and running, with a user logged in. OK. Do you know what the X display's ID is?
I'm guessing it's :0 ?
It's probably something like :0.  OK. If it is, then run something in the remote session, and add -display :0 to it.
All right, that's it?
I'm guessing that will give you an error, since security is probably turned on..  But it's worth a try before attempting to figure out anything more difficult! :)
I'll try it out in a second. I have to wait until the current user is ready
As an alternative, in the ssh you can type "export DISPLAY=:0".  Then all X programs will use that display by default, w/o specifying -display :0
Works PERFECTLY. Thanks!
No problem. Just be careful, whatever you start shows up on the X display and is running as YOU..  So, if you have the privs to wipe out a directory full of irreplaceable photos, and the person receiving the screen accidentally deletes them... well. :)

powernow: No PST tables match this cpuid (0x7a0). powernow: This is indicative of a broken BIOS.. anyone with this?
tried that already... no reply.. "connection timed out; no servers could be reached"
cat /etc/[URL]nf # what do you have in there?
two lines, nameserver x.x.x.x and another one similar (with real ips)
ok, what are those ip addresses?
these are the same ips that I have in the network manager. I think that these are the ips of the DNS of my ISP, since I see the same numbers in the windows box (that works)
ok, try these IP addresses instead 204.117.214.10 and. 217.32.105.91
eh?
it fails on install.
But if i want to add icons who i downloaded?
If you want to use a custom set of icons, you need to copy them via console (you need permissions) to /usr/share/icons.  Then they'll show up in the list at "Customize" where you went before
Example I have my icons unpacked on my desktop i need to move to that librrary i need to put in the console sudo cp /home//Desktop/Icons to /usr/share/icons?
That's right.  Once they're copied properly to /usr/share/icons, go back to where i first told you (close and open if you didn't close it) and you'll have the option to choose your custom icons
Tnx :D
No problem =)
! lamp is Linux Apache MySQL and PHP.
...but lamp is already something else...
do not start up, don't display the applets and get freeze.  hehehehe. I have to install xfce :P
apt-get install fluxbox :)
Strangely I cannot access it from the LiveCD. It was properly shut down before as far as I remember. I'll try those commands, thanks! :D
wait no.  can you get into it from computer or whatever you got on Xubuntu?.  or /media or /mnt ?
I checked in /mnt and /media, they're both empty..  So don't use those commands?
they would probably be ok, but as long as you shut Windows down properly, you should just be able to access it from Ubuntu/Xubuntu
its not working with ff its working with opera but its too slow.  dont know why
maybe you have installed some addons which block the site
the more core issue is it not showing a prompt when I set up a package requiring configuraiton. How can I enable the prompts again?
I'm looking
thanks. If it helps, it's a brand new box from leasweb with Ubuntu Server 12.04.3.
What was the *exact* command you entered to install?
apt-get install mysql-server
Try running (no quotes) "export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=text" then remove & reinstall mysql-server....let me know if that prompts you
doing so.
I'll brb - gonna grab smokes & a bite to eat. Will check in w/ you when I return

oh ok
any time in the GUI press CTRL+ALT+F1 to get to a console and CTRL+ALT+F7 (or F10) to get back
yes but i only have one monitor
but more than one virtual desktop. You're using compiz?
ahh thats true.  2 virtual desktops, yes i am using compiz
you have compiz configuration setting manager installed?
yes
what plugin do you use to switch the desktop? Desktop wall? Cube?.  if you're using Desktop wall (on by default), turn of "Edge flip move"
oops. i thought i had compiz installed, but i removed it, i was thinking of the nvidia driver
so you're using metacity? I don't know how to do it on metacity, sorry
how would I backup then?
read what i wrote
heh it was appreciated by me though. meh oh well
:/
ok thought I'd see if someone came up with an install method or something for the old interface
well, you could try unity or Lubuntu if that doesnt run fluid enough
??? what version?
hold on. 2.6.10-5. that's mine, I don't know if it's bleeding edge, or not. (in relevance to the repos0. *)
i used jscalibrator on it
That's not a problem
unfortunately it is 'cause axes stopped working
Even after a reboot?
yep. i unplugged the controller
Try 'jstest'
i even completely removed jscalibrator.  jstest works fine
So what's wrong exactly?
I need to install this: The LinuxTV project DVB code, with my version of mt352.c installed in place of the distributed version. This snapshot from CVS should build out of the box (and includes my mt352.c);
do you actually understand what your doing ?
so I can make RAID work on a VM ?
yeah software RAID.. but you should probably just use LVM as you can shrink/exapand partitions
LVM sounds better , still the same question can I use it on VM ?
yes, it's all done on a software layer

im on Ubuntu 11.10 64bit.  how do u explain notepad++ works on me?
thats x86 64-bit extention, but it runs in 32-bit mode
u mean notepad++ 6.1 is x86 binary?
indeed
okie, make sense...
how to do it
how did you back them up?
no. i ll try that
shubbar: sudo apt-get install openal0a. if it's already installed then i'm not sure what else the problem could be
waistless, "E: Couldn't find package openal0a"
shubbar: sorry, it's sudo apt-get install libopenal0a
waistless, "libopenal0a is already the newest version."
shubbar: so it's already installed. I'm not sure what the problem might be then
ok interesting.  im in a hex editor right no, how would i determine the format?
Look at the file extension? :D
in case there is none?
MIME type.
mime type? =/
Usually you can see the MIME type of a file in Gnome by rightclicking the file and then selecting "properties"
i just use the hex editor tho. where would i see it there
On the first tab, where it says type.
no inside the hex editor!
There's a long description (e.g. "PDF-document" for a pdf) and then the MIME type in brackets (e.g. application/pdf for a pdf file)
i tried to upgrade to 8.04 from 7.10 and i was told to delete 7.10 with the manual partitioner on install, and when i tried to create new partitions i did it all wrong. i have the wrong sizes for the wrong parts, also i tried to resize them loading the livecd but i cannot since i have my /home inside my extended
can you just delete the new partitions and then try it again? rather than tring to resize?
simple basic and able to snapshot from a webcam?. cheese is the name? i'll check er out thanks zyko
yup, cheese is the name.
Yes, the servers are correct (as entered in System -> Admin -> Networking)
*shrug* I've seen similar things when the secondary or tertiary nameservers are wrong
Hmm, I'll try removing the secondary one, maybe it's wrong
did you try pinging them?
Pinging works fine (on the first one, removed the second one now). Aha. Removing the secondary DNS server seems to have solved it. It must be wrong then. Thanks for the help!
no problem
not with fullscreen X apps like SDL/fullscreen
SDL ?
Simple Directmedia Layer (sort of DirectX/without 3d of Linux) used by most games etc.
a-ha I don't think so then :(.  Perhaps it's changing and you can't see the change.
the problem is that SDL "fullscreen" is true fullscreen via X request, not just a "fake maximize" and so the WM is completely "off the hook"
:(
I wanted to at least fake default keybindings (perhaps find out current ones) and tell the WM manually
Sounds like you know more than I do.  I think wmctrl will let you change workspaces via term commands
make and install
read the readme. it should have a make uninstall or make remove or equivalent
alright thanks. pidgin :)
you can install pidgin from the repositories.  sudo apt-get install pidgin
yeah, i thought i decided to be smart and downloaded the latest version from their site. hmm
I really do not recommend installing from source when there are perfectly good packages available.
its nested a few deep from the folder i'm starting in, does that matter?
of course. Lets assume, your folder is in ~/some/where/.hiddenfolder and you open the terminal (you start in your home, "~" or /home/yourname/), then you have to rm -r ./some/where/.hidden*
then how do i start in a directory and delete every instance of a target directory under, no matter how deep?
that would be "find"
in this case it's audio/music/3ef/.mediaartlocal thats one of maybe 200.  do youy know of a way to make search show hidden files?
i am not good with find, i can only offer the command to chmod every file, hidden included, recursively. (chmod doesnt recurse hidden files): find . -type f -exec chmod 0755 {} \; consult the man page: man find
oky thanks :)
i'll have a look to the man page myself. Try to understand it meanwhile, too ;-)
i did it with search
cool
places>search for files> there is a hidden file's checkbox type deal.  thanks much for your help :)
lol
How? Can you please elaborate, thanks for replying
well it depends on your needs.  as you describe it seems the server is configured to hand out routing via vpn
Yes
can you influence the openvpn server?
No, its an corporate server.  I've no control over it
but can you control local routing on that system?.  you'd have to delete the default route set by ovpn
a single web site
man wget
where can I find the urls to the 'multiverse' repositories?
!tell  about repos
thnx
: thre are many to choose actually
there is no such version [URL]
u can list all version in here. i'm too lazy to open it
oks. Linux IA32. Linux IA64. Linux amd64/em64t. freebsd. thats it
Linux IA32 i think
you think..? will it stuff up everything if its wrong?
coz you have intel-32bit proc. well, this sort of things usually end up with x86. IA64 is for Intel-64bit proc
how?
simplest way is telnet to it and see if it connects
are in there Russians
That is where your questions will be answered. !sudo. !gksudo
I accidently edited bashrc how can I get the defults back?
loook in /etc/skel for the original
can I copy an paste from that?
or just the file to your home.. /etc/skel$ ls -a. . .. .bash_logout .bashrc [URL]sktop .profile
I have put export PS1="\[\e[28;1m\]\w \[\e[0m\]\$ " in ~/.profile but not working why?
you started a new shell?
:-o ok. let me try. but it wont break down any kernel thingy or dpkg thingy right?
its just gets the packages straightened out, helps things a fair bit
ok.  i copy pasted all those command in one .sh file and then run it with sudo but nothing happends. terminsal sits there
works here (the file extension is meaningless in linux ;))
ok
did you put: #!/bin/bash as the top line?.  and mark it as executable?
nope. but it worked not. it told me to close synaptic.. yes its executable
yes you can only have oneapp accessing the packages at one time
*it worked now*
magic :)
:-)
the script assumes the packages are free
script worked. with errors. it cant access cd rom or can not fetch packages.gz from ubuntu site
remove the CD as a software source in software centre.  if you pastebin the text, we can advise
Any idea as to how I can check?
find out what your nic is and use google
ill look, thanks
too heavy there's one
what if i just want the old version?.  sorry to bother...
compile the software yourself
from the binaries?
yeah
psi.  There are no other OSes.
try checking Hard Drive settings in BIOS. need to set "Compatible" mode or something similar. Can't remember exactly, sorry
Psimyn: What BIOS settings did you change? There is no setting for RAID that I could find (4 yr old ASUS board).
what board are you using (model #)? When I did it I had to update BIOS, then it was IDE Configuration, and there was an item called "SATA Operation Mode", had to set it to Compatible
I was in the process of upgrading from 10.04 to 12.04, but it seems that 10.04 is still what's installed.
ouch, do you have a backup?
Id be all by myself!. ;-)
hehe. i am not an evolution expert myself
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found
@ what Ubuntu release are you running?
ah, right, it does have it..  I mean /usr/lib.  still no lzma.  is it in multi-verse or whatever it is that Ubuntu calls it?. ,liblzma2
@ sorry of you already said this, but what release of Ubuntu are you running?
2. The mouse pointer is like a block with pixels in different colors.  can't be changes. d
ubuntu's theme can't be canged?
btw its a fresh install
but did you keep your /home?
ah you mean gnome theme, I allready did that.  I said: a fresh profile
wierdness.. I'm still using hardy and intrepid
, final one I guess , its up to date.  , intro is perfect , main menu is perfect, loading is good, but game is unplayable
that didn't really answer my question
ok, so 100mb should be future-proof?
Unless you need more than 5 kernels at a time, it'll be fine.
ok, thx. oh, another question: does the choice between ext2/3/4 matter for /boot?. with regard to robustness, mostly
Go with ext2
I was worryied that might be it. how do I get more information about what caused it?
i had to use netconsole, theres probably a better way to do it though
pls
then ./<file>
thanks . but what actually is chmod
makes it executable.  what is the .bin file?
binary file
not what I meant, what is the program you are trying to install?
: bitnami lamp stack.  : its package fro apache , php and mysql
kk, looks like it should work just by running it.  if you have problems you probably need to run as root
kk.  its running
high five :)
from where i can get the info about different commands in linux
try "man <programname>"
what is it
for instance "man chmod".  the ubuntu system manual
: thanks
no problem
I was going to bring up that it's one of two things - your loopback network device is down or your firewall is filtering traffic on it
it happened a few days after i installed breezy. so i just reinstalled it, and it's never happened since
it was never working since this install of ubuntu.  where can i find an eariler version of it?
like ubuntu 9 version of it.  I had to do that when i upgraded my laptop, you're left with weaker wifi but that's better than no wifi
where do you find a driver that worked? did you use ndiswrapper or fwcutter? do you remember what guide you followed online if any?
I'm pretty sure i followed the steps here .  [URL]
thanks! this looks promising
np
That does not seem to be the right selection - Someplace else to try?
sorry, in the file manager, edit->prefs->behaviour (don't ask me what I was thinking, I don't know)
still the same.  it is still hanging
restart terminal and try again
I did twice. I should just use sudo
what ubuntu are you using?.  livecd?
10.04. no.  installed
how are you accessing terminal?
from rm to mp3. real media to mp3
does any app do that?
I dont know really thats why I am asking
ie in windows world or elsewhere
I am using ubuntu
let me check
I occasionally have overheating problems, and from what I've googled it looks like a design flaw in the heat sink... I didn't know if running ubuntu helped/harmed that problem at all
You can add sensors to Ubuntu (and windows I'm sure) and see which runs hotter.
I can just get these from software center right?
Well the software sensors are kind of tricky to install. I am looking up right now to do it to remind myself..  Would you like to do it together? I think I have remembered what to do.
that'd be great
First thing. install lm-sensors package
'sudo apt-get install lm-sensors' works fine?
yeah
ok done
Are you using 11.04 ? with unity?
yes I am
Can you add applets to the panel at the top? I can't remember. There is an applet called 'hardware sensors monitor' that is handy. Shows the temperatures at all times..  Otherwise you have to keep running the command in the terminal to see the actual temperatures
perhaps, but packages shouldn't be broken, eol or not. manually installed the dependency and it's happy though
did you add a ppa?
nah. at least not that would affect this
can you explain what you been trying to do exactly?
apt-get install libopenvg1-mesa-dev
yes, but why?
grabbing the build deps for qt5
can this help? [URL]
yeah what is it?
never ever use words like any1 or 2 again
sure. I promise.
good.. what is your problem then?
here please look at this. [URL]  sorry, [URL] that is exactly my situation
OK, reading etc
except, it was mispoint grub root/setups that did it. gah
That site requires a login which i'm not inclined to sign up for right now
thats fine, can i paste something to your privately? do you see my current pm?
innomen: No, no pm shows. Likely your name is not registered on freenode yet
oh it it, let me log in. see it now?
I have found the online manpage, reading it now
I can only ssh to it
ok lshw or lspci
is it safe?
x404x, it removes everything.  messing with storage is always dangerous
safe like, i wont loose any data thats already on that partition
messing with storage is always dangerous
true .. any recomendations? i have a 60 gig extra store partition on my hdd, and i have 30 gigs free that i need to add to that partition
if you're asking if linux re-partioning applications are more likely to destroy data than windows equivalents. then no. its fine.  gparted
i have ubuntu and windows; i can boot xp, but can't boot ubuntu
Okay, are they both on the same hard drive?
devron: i have ubuntu and windows; i can boot xp, but can't boot ubuntu. i'm on live now.  yes
open up terminal
ok
type e2label /dev/hda1 if it says device not found type sda1. what is the return
for hda1 not found, for sda1 bad magic number
okay type sda2
just does writeline (c# thing)
okay  do this. fdisk /dev/sda
sda2?
once in there press p 'print'. no just /dev/sda. 'fdisk /dev/sda' then 'p' for print
done
what was the output
should i paste you on the pastebin?
yes
http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
okay  one moment
thank you in advance!!!
press ctrl c to exit out of fdisk. and now type sudo grub. and give me the output
just enters grub shell; grub>
yes. once in grub>. type find /boot/grub/stage1. read me the output
hd(0,1). i thought it was
so now type. root hd(0,1). i mean. wait. type 'root (hd0,1)
ok
'root (hd0.1)'
i type the question mark key and i get and I type shift 6 and i get ? instead of the upper arrow
Krys and you haven't enabled any 2ndary langages under keyboard settings?
not that I know of. i *just* installed ubuntu, first time using it. k let me look
Krys preferences>keyboard>Layouts
yeah, I know where the keyboard preferences are.. it says us english
and under model krys what does it say?
Is it in fstab too?
yup, UUID=909f42a6-15fd-4644-a71f-9736e004dbcb none swap sw 0 0
right. my issue is that every video on my system are played in slow motion. lspci -k doesn't list any drivers under gfx card, nor does lshw -c display. i915 is lited on livecd though, so I'm trying to figure out how to force i915 to be used for gfx card
So pastebin "sudo lspci -k" please.
[URL]  lsmod lists i915 with a 0 next to it
So it is loaded and you are using it.
but lspci -k doesn't list it, unlike under LiveCD.  also, lsmod lists i915 with a 4 next to it under LiveCD
So which Ubuntu is it?
livecd or live system?
The system.
yes, pretty unnerving
only way i guess to make dumps and listen offline
thats ugly
they call it to take a podcast. lol they comeup with xpvistawin
getting the comp in suspend mode using gksudo
oh ok
sorry I should of put that - the desktop is gnome
there's a way with gconf, don't know if there's a GUI option. Are you comfortable with gconf
how do you gget to gconfig
type Alt-F2 and enter the following: gconf-editor
ok

says it is PS/2, and it in fact is, and emulate3buttons is not on.  you get that?
yep
but, my mouse is actually USB but uses one of those USB->PS2 converter thingies. is that bad?
try enabling it and reloading X.  no, that's fine
turn on emulate3buttons?
yeah, give that a shot if your protocol is already "ExplorerPS/2".  then reload X with control+alt+backspace (but you probably already know that)
it isnt ExplorerPS/2, but just PS/2, but i will try that. thought that was only for older mice though?
it usually is, but sometimes old protocols work better
for cpu virtualization?. im talkin about amd-v or the VT-v or watever intel has
vbox? qemu xen or what
vbox. but im talkin about hardware virtualization
best try in #vbox
like adding more then 1 core. in bios. but even when the guest os isnt runninig. is when i notice it
easy on the enter key, its impossible to follow you
no they are different
no idea. i allways use the alternate cd
even i use alternate cd .
thats why, when installing kernel packages the postinstall script of the kernelpackage runs update-grub which creates an entry in the menu.lst for each kernel it finds in /boot. as both have a different /boot you cant see the other installations entries in the others grub
quik share for #ubuntu
[URL]/ or http://snag.gy/ are two i like, many more. or course there are dropbox like thingies. of. ack [URL] is down atm
weird, I didn't get grub to come up. I installed the rt kernel and it was in grub. then $ sudo reboot now!. and I can't get it .. then I do a hard reboot and it just boots me into generic with no choice
oh ok you need to edit your menu.lst
it calls home, whip out ethereal and watch
i dont believe your bs
Don't believe me, but it's true. tcpdump and a packet filter fixes that, but it's well known
brb. uh wait
I know what grep and sed is for, but after reading the manual for couple of hours I give up :)
does my hint help?
let me see.  so what optio0n do I put here?
huh? -o is the option
I didnt get your point
read what the -o option does in grep
I read it many time. does not help. how to describe that I want domain name after =. ?
so what does it do?.  still there?
yeah
looked up what -o does yet?
yes
well, what does it do?
ok thanks alot
I don't have much experience with KDE though
i am using gnome too
ok
yes
and you've done those twists to make it not prompt you? It's defaoult ubuntu behaviour
well yea it asks if i want to allow nm-applet to access it and i said yes.  but it still asks on startup
It prompts you everytime you start up... security measure. oops...  , It prompts you everytime you start up... security measure
thanks, but isnt that kind of cheaing?. cheating*
no such thing as cheating :P
yes
latest stable is 10.10 maverick meerkat

so in /etc/profile put export FLASH_FORCE_PULSEAUDIO=1. ?
that would probably do the trick. why do you want to do this anyway, if i may be so curious.?
because its the only way to get flash sound to work with pulse audio. FLASH_FORCE_PULSEAUDIO=1
shouldn't that be some sort of local configuration for firefox? i dunno. try shutting your webbrowser, opening a console and typing the following:
thanks
Do you know if there is a way to make the theme darker? Like the window headers and panels? They look gray, not black..  No problem.
myrtti - when you boot up you have the progress bar - when shutting down - you get a progress bar. on hibernate there is no progress bar- just a ugly black screen with a cursor flasshing.
I don't think there is anything like that available or even being designed yet
J-W i typed that into terminal
ok then install deluge again, if I'm not mistaking you wil get another error (missing package) and after that it will work :)
yep, thanks
yw =P
it's okay, i just do that so that whoever didnt know a solution, get to know it :)
Very Ubuntu of you, thanks. :).  Just pulled up the homepage for it now. :). !help | terraplane
just wanted to see if anyone was here lol.. i installed ubuntu 14.04. i started it from grub before and the fan worked in full blast for some reason. it happen a couple times.. idk why.
Try to keep your posts all in one post.
and then?
you seem to have it set to en_US ?
i can not imagine that that will help
where is locales set to?
de
that could be the reason then
hui, nice.  good choise
I use mp3roaster. a perl hac to burn mp3/ogg/and .flac to cd' s. hack. it rules and freed me from k3b
im not sure. I get different outputs from top vs gnome system monitor
with top you can sort on mem usage
which column is memory usage? VIRT? RES?
virt is swap mem res is resident ram
is that the accurate usage? my music player for example shows 92m in top, and 69MiB in system monitor
maybe gnome adds virt and res
I've got the server name from outlook express, but I can't configure it on thenderbird
You just put it in as an IMAP server, and (if you're on it's local network) the SMTP server. If you're not on it's local network, you may have to find another SMTP server. For whatever reason the thunderbird build in ubuntu doesn't let you save your account & account settings if the SMTP server is bad/non-existant/not-responding.
The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.
its gonna be gstreamer-mad or whatever
where is it?
universe.
simple please, like me
!universe |
tonyrusso, whats universe?
that was for the bot - a sec
tony, ok
!universe | . maybe?
?
they are executed before the interface is brought up
right.  thats fine.. thats what i meant.  they arent executed at all.  thats the problem
really ?.  what type of card
my network works.. its just I made an iptables-restore script.. but it doesnt restore
thats not done in the pre-up scripts
where is it done?
that should be done in an init script
the game has a linux version too
I know thast. ive just never seen it work under linux
how often is it copied to the "real" crontab?
if it doesnt, it will not work as expected..  It will be checked and copied (or not copied) whenever you call crontab -e
no, the script looks like "ruby test.rb"
Then your script will not perform as expected. using cron, there is no user environment, not PATH defined, nothing.
so i call "crontab -e" and it is empty. i presume this means that it was not copied properly?.  ok, so fully define ruby's path as well then? gotcha
Your attempt contained errors so it was not copied..  "* * * * * /growth/growth/testscript.sh" would be correct.
that is what i have, i meant my testscript.sh file does not use full paths.
Define _every_ path fully. _never_ use relative paths..  Yeah, that applies for every script called by crontab, too.
ok so i have ***** /growth/growth/testscript.sh that i wrote after calling sudo crontab -e,
***** is wrong. there have to be whitespace in between.
that is what i meant. there is whitespace in between. and there is whitespace between the permissions and the filename.
Permissions?.  in crontab, you do not define any permissions.
sorry, schedule..  my mistake.
Yeah, and every path in your script has to be a full path. Literally every path.
i have updated all the scripts to use the full path..  so in ruby there is a function called require_relative that grabs the full path and prepends it to the file name... no idea why i would have to change that as it is embedded in the ruby files.
thats out of interest :).  but "ruby file.rb" should be "/full/path/to/ruby /full/path/to/file.rb" - the ruby code itself, unless you specify filenames, can be left unchanged.
i guess my main concern right now is why when i run crontab -e the initial command is not even showing up (regardless if the full paths of the ruby files are being included or not). like i said the only line in my testscript.sh is "/home/ubuntu/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin/ruby /growth/growth/main.rb" which is a full path. so i am not sure why after writing out that with nano it would not copy to crontab
do you quit nano like ctrl-o ctrl-x ?
yep, i have the full file path which is why i am confused as to why it is not copying to the cronjob.  yes..  ctrl-o to write out, ctrl-x to save, is that the problem?
Is the filesystem (/) writeable?
windows mobile
oh :(
ya. as primary master
I don't have any experience with gparted for cloning, but gparted copies the MBR from the old drive as well when it clones?.  and have you loaded it back into gparted and make sure that the partitions that should be are marked as bootable?
hmm no i didn't check if they're marked as bootable.. let me see if there is an option for that
it's a per-partition setting, I'm no expert on what it means, and it shoudl have cloned that stuff, past checking those things I won't be of any help, good luck
I can't get that either :S
that's odd... what ubuntu version?
precise

I installed crunchbang then linuxmint. It's mint.
ok - so nothing to do with ubuntu so not supported here
Okay, just curious, since crunchbang IS ubuntu with a few extra things installed.

is there a way to get it to recognize the 4ghz speed? It's stuck at 3.3ghz which is even lower than the stock clock.
what cpu is it
an amd fx 8320
and what does scaling_available_frequencies say
3300000 2900000 2300000 1700000 1400000. It wouldn't move past 1.7 until I turned off powersave
you should check the bios to see if it's set properly
it is, in windows it's recognized
i didn't say windows, i said bios
in bios it shows 4.0 ghz
4ghz is the turbo frequency, it wouldn't be set to that
I overclocked.. decreased the multi, dropped ram freq, etc, increased fsb, then balanced off the frequencies of ram and nb and got it stable. but for some reason, this os won't detect it
sounds more like you underclocked
both are poor
we know gnash has a long way to go, but we can't do anything about adobe's flash, but which one is installed?

you should ask in ##hardware.  then no, its a different socket
But I have read they are compatible somehow
i'd ask in ##hardware to clarify
when I try to join #hardware it says I need an invitation for that server o.O. oh ##hardware. let me try with two # :D
if you register and identify, you can join it
what command?
try running this>> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<<
nope. says Unreconized Command
then I guess your install is not complete have you removed the CD?
no. the config says its not a linux Cd. THERE IS GAIM. TARD~
that error I have seen once - and only once - what version is that CD?
you on ppc?
Riddell: no i386 it says :)
ah what would that be ?
dont remember sorry, just google for it. but i've 2.7.7 now
2.7.9 has been out for at least 2 weeks
found it. still here ? you need this pidgin-ppa_0.0.[URL]b
yeah, thats what i have
just install it and you can upgrade to the newest version =)
nope... not working here
you can update it from the software center then
no
thats they way how it worked for me
is it better as opposed to synaptic
do what ever your comfortable with.  there is no better.  it is harder, in terms of understanding what your doing
but from what i understand it is good when uninstalling an app, is it true that it removes any depends that came along with it?
if you use synaptic and have problems then ask how to remove something, it can help, there are other tools, dpkg if you want to be cruel :)
the problem is, that not all fonts are small. only a group of fonts
font size may be dependent on the webpage designer, not firefox
hmm. upgrades are incomplete. a file is locked. I lost the message. sigh, now I caan't figure out how to recreate the problem
try using sudo apt-get install -f (option to fix broken) otherwise, try to get the error again and post a link to the error at a paste site like [URL]
how can I get around the sudo security thing? it doesnt let me fix my /etc/hosts
use recovery mode
tryed that no joy
please run "file sc_trans_linux"
i tryed chmod 755 also
please run file against it
and sh sc_t.....
LISTEN please run file against it
I tried not working. source files has been removed,
then you need to contact the program publisher for assistance
would that reinstall my apps?
no, but when you did reinstall them, you could put back in your custom settings with those files
thanks

a theme? very unlikely
yes. Does it slow down system?
very unlikely
Do you know other good themes?

under services does it come under 'Actions scheduler'?

bashrc will only get sourced everytime you start a terminal
what do you mean?
everytime you start a bash terminal, it reads .bashrc. outside of that terminal then, your environment variables would not be set

no, just downloaded it to a stick and extracted the files
that's why no boot image. [URL]
what to do
:-).  don't worry we have all been there. Read the article to create bootable version of ubuntu
will do and yhanks. thanks
don't mention it
no , i think not ,how would i know ?
pastebin your /etc/apt/[URL]st file for me please
I knew kde was a bug
:D
that wasn't what you meant, was it :)
no, but I do agree :)
: thanks
sure. np
had to mount it manually with vfat.  no i do not because its a freedos boot disk and i need to copy a firmware to it
i've had intermittent issues with floppies going back and forth from winders ... i'm not sure what the issue is exactly, windows never has problems reading floppies, linux sometimes cannot going from windows to linux.  ah!
I need to get my mp3 collection back to a windows partition. it is too big for even a dvd
use fat then
mkfs.vfat: Attempting to create a too large file system. thats what I get
ok. the solution is to fix that rather than try and make an ntfs partition tho
how?.  nvidia-glx-config disable/enable? this is the only command i know
[URL] Hopefully that'll work =)
apt-get df -h.  apt-get df -h
no... it's a stand alone command. no need to download that.  no need to apt-get that... it's just a command

never heard of, sorry. intel tends to work well in my experience, though.
you mean answers there?
i just noticed many are at the site. and some were in python. i was going to get that one and examine the code to try to write my own.. someday. :) but never had the time
well actually im trying to build mine, but i just wanted to know how to pick my own icon. >D
bbl - off to the store
if mount fails on that dev, is it just not installed or something?
the cd/dvd should automount when you put a disk in.  are you on a server?
no its a desktop and it didnt automount.  so makes me wonder if all is ok. odd b/c the cd and dvd drive do automount, the dvd-ram doesnt
in a terminal, run "dir /etc", look for sr0. magi22: Oh its a DVD-RAM drive you're using. magi22: RAM disk I mean
nope not in there.  but cdrom and cdrom1 are not in there either (those are the devices for my cdrom and dvd drives)
Right now, if you were to put a regular CD or DVD in, does it automount?
yes the cd and dvd do but only in those drives (i have 3 drives).  anything in the dvdram doesnt mount.  auto or by guessing the mount /dev/? /mnt cmnd
I'm confused, you have 3 optical drives, 2 of which work no problem.
yes.  but those 2 dont write, i need the dvd-r
I'm not sure if Linux supports RAM drives. Does the DVD-R drive automount a standard DVD?
What do you mean ?
you are in a terminal yes?
yes, I am
well type ls -l /path/to/jarfile. and tell me what comes up
cannot access /downloads/. lol. I don't know what I'm doing ?
ls -l /downloads
same message, no such file or directory
what is /downloads
is that the same actual problem ?
yes, 'System hangs with kernel 3.19.0-31'
there mail icon is there, so it seems i already have the indicator applet
if you see mail that is correct. did you try to uninstall pulse audio or something? how did you loose it?
i don't know
is audio working?
yep perfectly
does "apt-cache policy indicator-sound" show as installed?
i see "Installed: (none)" so i assume i don't have it
install it then ;)
[URL]
looks like you have a broken package. try running "sudo apt-get -f install" and see if it helps.
just sudo apt-get -f install?
yup "sudo apt-get -f install"
[URL]
doesn't show any broken packages! try "sudo apt-get install indicator-sound" again
indicator-applet is already the newest version.
indicator-applet or indicator-sound?
the sound icon that comes with indicator applet
i thought you said indicator-sound wasn't installed on your system..  "apt-cache policy indicator-sound" should show an installed version
i said the sound-icon wasn't appearing when i added the indicator applet
"Installed: 0.2.3-0ubuntu1"
Installed: (none) Candidate: 0.2.3-0ubuntu1
right it's NOT installed on your system - just install it..  good luck.
1 terabyte
Go with NTFS...
all I know is apache 2 is installed and working
Do you know where your siteroot is?
not sure, it used to be in var/www/ before the upgrade
Is gallery2 a php/cgi script?
it's a installa pkg in synaptic
Okay let me find some info on it, hold on
ok.  u know something about point2play?
yes, but i have never used it.  GUI to cedega right ?
jeps
so, what about it ?
I see a ot of port 80 set for the repos, I still wonder why
that's not the default, are you still using your local repo?
I know it from the past and my provisioning setup get's it from somewhere, I'm not sure yet from where
sounds like a bug in your provisioning setup
what did you have to do?. i installed it, but when I try to connect to a network it scrolls and then just dies
It seems to work out of the box for some people
sigh.... dammit!
comment all your network interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces
ok
and reboot
-the compiz things came by default, I need to uninstall those? Official packages meaning those not from synaptic?
sure, uninstall eveything with compiz or beryl in the name.  then install compiz again, double-check that you dont have any 3rd part repos in your sources
so should I do removal or 'complete removal'
i did a complete. purged all configs. then reintalled. reinstalled*
try alsa output plugin
The little window that shows the volume appears though.
does the slider work or does it stay in one place?.  (for the gnome volume slider?)
the applet that shows up?
the speaker thing on the gnome panel.  you click it and a slider appears, windows-style?
I just got done saying that it won't add itself to the panel.
ah right. hmm.  maybe a reboot would be worth a shot?
I just rebooted and it stopped working.
maybe another reboot would make it start working then?.  worth a shot I guess
this isn't Windows, but I'll try it.
I see. thought it was just ubuntu with a face lift
good ui is an opinion so never concrete. you can install many different DE/WMs on ubuntu..  it not a canonical release
too much trouble. ok then
try a few DEs. see which you like
I have tried many many. I will try mint now
mint is a distro, not a de
an android
does the phone get detected?
yes.. there are two options usb tethering.. and wifi hotspot. I can connect to the hotspot and the usb internet connection gets detected. by when when i try to browse or do anything online i get no connection
then how does you know that the internet connection is detected? check System > preferences> network
okay ive 'tethered' my andriod via usb. i get a wired network connection 'auto usb0' active showing
can you connect to internet now?
maybe... but is there ab tool for that?. *an
not that i know of specifically
Eh, not really.
jasunto: I don't know what windows and rdp is
The installation doesn't cover the hours of configuration
what takes hours to configure?
how to?
i had the same problem, and my (somewhat simple) fix, was to restart X and not start smplayer heh
meaning? i can apt-get install it?
sure
uhm, i cant install or boot liveCDs cause of this.. and im not sure on howto fix it
try tapping f12 at powering on the computer to get a boot from menu, and choose the cd reader, or usb what ever your trying to boot,.
uhm ive been doing that
tab nics so we can see who you are responding to when you hit f12 what menu do you get?
boot from CDROM or HARDDRIVE.
what is the computer model and manufacturer?
I see, thank you for the information. Know where I can read more about the decision?
never seen anywhere about the decision.
it didnt work
how did it fail?
it seems to be erased with that command.. than i try apt-get install apache2 and Setting up apache2 (2.0.54-5ubuntu4) .... ops.  i think it was installed, but i cant found /etc/apache2
that's strange. If you succeed in fully removing it with apt-get --purge remove, it should then install cleanly (including the conf dir)
can i paste the message after remove in pvt?
yes, use http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
You mean I need to write some sort of kick-start file?.  For the time being I am installing entire system with /boot and /, then merge it and tar-copy over the network to its destination.
no I mean write a file that grub reads at startup to show you the list of OSs to boot
i set up a vhost and now trying to set up the vhost for the ssl (https)
ok, so what are you stuck with ?
can get to the main [URL]
(don't forget you need to not use name based virtual hosts)
but get 404 for remaining of site. yeah I did
so what do you actually need help with
trying to figure out why I can get to main index when accessing https but not to the rest of the site
what does the log for your IP based virtual host say for the SSL site
it will work with the m4a in the statement?
tweak as needed.  make it executable and run
so just change the file extension to .m4p, make it executable, and then run?
that is an audo file yes? I assume that's what your trying to do? t
cool, let me look into that.  thanks :).  hm looks like my device isnt' in the supported devices list: [URL]
SocialEvil: Then detach the session.
iirc not that slow.. it stayed in the last text message for about a min or two before it loaded x server.  you should try supplying those boot parameters to kernel .. select text mode boot, then in boot prompt type expert ( or install ) acpi=off or irqpoll=off etc
k, thx
how new is the laptop? latest laptops using intel chipsets like 965 and core2duo use EFI BIOSes and pose those problems, eg with usb legacy option

-bash: chkconfig: command not found. dont work on my ubuntu. :(. ubuntu 9
because it isn't installed by default. "sudo apt-get install chkconfig"
yeas. but I dont know the answer
are you running software center while installing in a terminal, for example?
mmm maybe!. let me check. nope. not that I can see
ok, it could be an automatic repo update. try again in a minute or two.
ok. and it its not working any way?. any sugestions?
if it still doesn't work, use pgrep and pkill to find the stray dpkg/apt process, and kill it.
wow. sorry man. dont know how to use that
try 'pkill dpkg'
ok!. now it works. but I got stuck on a screem
that says what?
got it!. got it. thank youuuu
np :)
cheers
afaik firestarter has a bunch of redundant rules and shorewall is text based but has alot of features
i have problems with it in a way it runs fine, i install something else it breaks because of some linux kernel headers, and i have to install again by hand
just use amaranth's repository
yeah? i somehow think i tried and then i gave up and used the shellscript.  but ok.. i will give it a try again...
I installed amaraaanths nvidia-blx and it runs fine here without kickups or breakage. glx*
VLC crashes
if u do mplayer /file/location from comand line it will tell you error
where?
[URL], search on bug reports
In terminal type that.
everytime I do something in kde it asks me for the wallet crap ;/
downgrade by 3 versions. no thanks. I have simplifymedia running on it
3? i thought 7 was the newest. theyre on 9 now?
so anything doing upnp should work fine no?. YEa. Yeah. I tunes 9
wow. ok. well umm...yeah, apple doesnt want you to share music, thus you dont share music. and you thought it was your computer, eh?
Linux Lite 1.0.6 LTS
Dalek5whr: that isnt supported here
I know but their support channel is always dead and it's derived from ubuntu
Dalek5WHR: ask in #linuxlite
:can u help me.  Target Filesystem doesn't have /sbin/init this is my problem
yes i will try.  when does this happen,what are you trying to do
query. i try Ctr+Alt+F2,but i cant type the command
what command?
sudo mount -t ext3 -o rw /dev/hda1 /mnt sudo chroot /mnt sudo apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get install udev
why are you doing these commands?
i saw this :[URL]
creating a chroot for something it seems
Cafuego, I have tried putting my ip address into the browser and it comes up saying i need a user name and password to get into my dlink moderm.
Then you need to set up the d-link modem to forward tcp port 80 to the internal IP of your Linux machine.
how do I do that?
Log in to the modem web interface, find out where to configure forwarding, enable it...
thanks!
it's in system > administration.  all the gnome tools have the same naming convention- for example the network tool is network-admin
I don't have a panel... I just installed ubuntu, but I can't log in to a normal gnome session, only the failsafe terminal. And I can't run any gnome apps. Something with gnome is hosed.
damn, is it with all users? maybe your user account is screwed up. have you tried creating a new user?
ah. yes it was so simple. thank you. that was great
Glad you got it working.
yes . relabel
Probably, I never needed to though...
thanks!. gedit?. or nano. right
whatever suits you
im at command line
sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx ;).  then you have to change [URL]nf to use nvidia driver :)
i need to download it. it is already set to nvidia. But i get an error saying failed to load module "nvidia" (module does not exist,0)
o.k. so you're installing nvidia-glx now, right?
how can i do that if posible :)
[URL]
I am using a laptop and if you're walking around for quick meetings it's better to just sleep and wakeup. But nvm, I dont want to talk about the pros and cons just get it working ;)
it's even better to just have it running and not sleeping
preferably one that has IRC.  yea i have 4 already. i need another one
what happens?. does it go back to prompt?
no idea what that is but you fail because thats not NZDT
hehe yea.. north america, eastern time zone. you do win
xmms is using alsa. but how can i make TS use alsa
does it have no option to select alsa?.  assuming the teamspeak binary is named 'teamspeak' try this as root (sudo su to get root) # echo "teamspeak 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
theres only three options in TS for sound devices: 1.default (oss/dev/dsp), 2.default network 3.other
try what I said, replacing 'teamspeak' with the name of the teamspeak binary.  running teamspeak through 'aoss' might also work
the echo command didnt help
you replaced 'teamspeak' with the exact name of the teamspeak binary?
ya but think going from the old LTS to the new one will be easy?
LTS to LTS is supported.
sweet
preparation: move your /home to a dedicated /home, clean up your system, back up and your data. That way, if you have to clean install, you can keep your data
you tube
rgr that, i couldn't play them either without installing java (the full version from sun, not the open source plugin)
How? And will that make it use the right sounds, or just make it stop using the internal speaker?
in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
OK, but will it start playing the right sounds by doing that? I still prefer the internal beep rather than no sound at all
well, i am not quite sure
Is there any way to just unload that module temporarily to test?
rmmod pcspkr
Hmm, now I just get no sound, can I reload the module?
modprobe pcspkr
but when I run it. it fails with [URL]
what is the output of "df"
[URL]
we have found the problem: there's no room left on /boot
yes
Does your installation or base media support the filesystem you are attempting to install?
yes
what command are you running?. And your output?
i used fdisk to create the partition, then tried running mke2fs -j /dev/sdb1
and the output?
it says can not stat /dev/sdb1. The device apparently does not exist; did you specify it correctly?
You did reboot the whole system? I can always clear that error with a reboot. (Sorry to ask this again)
oh dear.... Well.... umm...
what exactly are you trying to do?
Edit the code
pick a piece of software you're interested in, and work on that one. gedit has it's own source, firefox it's own, etc
through software sources?
yep
are you using 2 different size monitors. IE are they the same resolution?
yeh. no
grr
i hav a laptop monitor and my external moniter. both different resolutions
- geez I really do wish it were that simple... But I'd need to install off of the cd right?
no
I'm talkin about their website :P
oh, lol.  is it a picture of Larry Ellison eating a hotdog and suing Linux companies?
i selected it from bios and then didnt get grub. just a black screen with flashing line. when i select the 8gb usb in bios it just boots straight to it though
thats because the bootloader is installed on the usb stick. You'll need to install grub to the external drive, or one of your internal drives
ooh i see. I thought it installed grub as well to the external.
hmm, I can' be certain - it may have just added an entry to your usb sticks grub menu
In the Gconf-Editor I should add, sorry.
I think it works the same way as movies anyway. !virtualbox. !vmware
I only get "Movie Player" when I right click on DVD. but it works on Video Files.
maybe the actsaul MPEGS on the DVD it self. you will have to say open with. Wubi is alright. try it
macc: thanks, but i have to upgrade, i don't think there is no other way :)
fix your scanner, idicate to them that it is wrong.  because it is wrong.  you can also point to each usn for each cve if you need to
haha thank you i feel retarded now
glad I could help :-)
it is a third party program that no one uses... it is real media analyzer... to fix rm files
perhaps you need -print0 for find?
it doesn't matter what rma does, i just need the end. print 0?. find doesn't have a print option
yes it does.  -print0 fixes the spaces-between-words issue with |
find -print0 . -iname *.rm. find: paths must precede expression: .
the . has to be first thing after find
OKi will try that.
what are you trying to do  /. ?. oh yeah... to test out the issue  : go to add remove and download a mysql front end ... to test ur login and password visually and not just from prompt...
noluck I changed the username in password in the mysql.txt and restarted apache and mysql. still no luck
ok... hold on.. 1 moment croc.  : go to add remove and install MySql Administrator ....  : also you need to do a stop before you alter mysql server files and then a restart of the service to initiate and complete any changes in the files ..
brb
ok
i have done that, thats what i meant about "its not muted"
there is no movement on "input level" even with "input volume" set to max?
thats what i wanna know and the sudo-command is also different
you'll also likely need to do this with the xserver shut down, you should print any instructions you need out, or have them up on another computer. CTRL+ALT+F1 will get you out, the sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop will get things shutdown for you
done that.
Are there any error message, or there is no sound?
actually vga=791 don't work either. with lilo
Ok, I am guessing lilo settings are different than grub
can i pm you?. this is a rather lenghty issue
yes but your chances are better if you keep it in the channel
let me try,
hardware abstraction layer. that too ^^. hackers at large ^^
check it out, it was never this complicated before, als had a guide to follow for ubuntu and fedora server, now building a VM again and cant find any good guides, its ubuntu server that boots and connects to PIA with openvpn and runs transmission. check it out now*
install network-manager-openvpn
this is headless server edition. thats for a desktop environment i beleive right?. i have lo and eth0, would expect another interface
well yes
--- i have
you have what ?
cause i read some paper on the web and is a little bit "strange". for example if i understanding well, u can read some file with SU without the super user power. is a little bit strange how i explain that. but i think this is the thing
start at the beginning, what do you wish to accomplish
i'm not a beginner, for u a beginner try to study some hard things about file perms?
you're not making much sense
i just wanna study how linux use the perms for rwx. that's it
[URL]
and where is the special perms? is not what i'm looking for. there's just the sticky bit
then look at the man page for chmod
hello, tks ans sorry my delay. I tried cat /proc/cpuinfo and cat /proc/stat. ACPI is enabled on kernel and I have no parametters disabling this one. but I think I found the problem, I'm compiling a new kernel. SMP was disabled in my config. let me see if will works
Yep, that'll do it.
Nvidia geforce 8600GT
no intel gpu too? sudo lshw -C display ,will show you.
product: G84 [GeForce 8600 GT]
what does it say after 'driver='
It's Ubuntu default driver...driver=nouveau.  When i install Nvidia drivers Unity stops working
then run: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.  you can try: sudo nvidia-xconfig ,then reboot. May help
isn't that the same this as installing from gui? In that case I'll probably have the same problem no?
no idea, i never use the GUI thing
hmm
did you try nvidia-xconfig to make an [URL]nf file?
shoot. I was just typing that
:p
yes
lsb_release -a.  type that in terminal it will tell you what you are one. on*
so how can you expect to share a desktop thats not been "logged in" yet. wouldn't it be better to enable the desktop sharing as a session service so that the second the user logs in the desktop sharing service is started
by that same token, BASH is also an application that requires a user to log in before it can be used, yet you can run scripts as a service account
couldnt find bmp
okay then aptitude search beep-media-player
What?
do you have hoary working already?
you can check with tune2fs to see the inode size. Older systems won't handle 256 byte inodes, but that appears to be the default for new releases.
ah
just a guess, but easy enough to check.
yeah.  what switch is it ;). for tune2fs. to identify inode count. -l isnt it :P
yes, the -l
and yes your right. the working FS has an inode size of 128, while ubuntu's is using 256
you have Inode size: 256 instead of Inode size: 128 ?
so i migth change that  and see if it works, ill email the guy at fs-driver and ask him if it he's planning on making it work with 256 sized inodes. also  the directory hash is different. the working drive is using tea, while the other is using half_md4
tune2fs can change those for you. -I and -E. See the man page.
any problem in me moving my root off onto another disk, and reformatting those disks to have a smaller inode. or might ubuntu not like that
system load as shown by e.g. uptime
that I do know... however some people thinks that CPU usage is the same as load... which it isn't...
the load displayed by uptime is 25 and i do not know the reason for it. i'd like to find out what causes this load.. any ideas where to look
it could be any number of things that could make it go up. I would need more specific details about your system to even make an estimated guess...
i figured as much, and ive already pured through forums. but will keep trying
try logging in to the channel at different times of the day and ask, try posting on the forum as well
Well, right now it's so I can dismount certain encrypted volumes I don't want mounted when they aren't in use. I have a solution but it's one I don't like; I'll rename gnome-screensaver to gnome-screensaver-bin and replace the original with a shell script more than likely is what i will do
that's not a horrible option. The other thing you could do is have a cron task that checks if the screen saver is running every 5 min
well maybe not horrible but it seems like there should be something in place to do that already. ive skimmed all the config files to no avail too. hadnt thought to check to see if the screensaver was running. i prefer that..  the reason i dont like to do "Wrapper" scripts is because it complicates uninstalling programs if i forget ive wrapped them later on.
I'd do the cron if I were you - easy check
yeah, that's probably what i will end up doing. thanks. i was trying to think of how to do it with cron but it never dawned on me to check to see if the screensaver was running. too much time on windows. anyway, thanks a lot.
don't ask him that - i hate that question
yes i do for my win machines
then clamav is good, there is a frontend too
Where's the right place, then?

My Luks partition (with system and all data) got damaged and I would like to recover the data from it... the problem is that this kind of partition is encrypted and normal recovery is impossible
do you remember your key?
that's not the point... it stopped to be visible as Luks partition and it's visible as unknown one
Yes, because it's encrypted, it cannot detect the file system, you have to decrypt it.
I had backuped some of the data on an PenDrive (Usb stick), but it seem that this ubuntu (12) has caused that it has been damaged in hardware way >.<. and no, I can't do any kind of raid when I have data on this disk... doing raid may damage them
@... You could try to backup your full partition with dd >.<. And mess with it after...
@ what would that give? I will remain in the same point as I'm now
Windows is evil... :P. Pretty much like governments...
I finally found it just now, how do I install it, its a tar file.  its a printer driver
well you can just klik on it
hey everyone, bear with us for one moment, we apologize for this.  that is perfect actually, because my rr didn't work at first :)
heh

thank you very much.
Open two terminal tabs. In one, type "while true ; do echo hello ; done". While this is running, cat /proc/cpuinfo again. You'll see them at full speed..  Press ctrl+c in your echo tab to stop it.
yep. I am ssh'd in right now.  everything is rinning great but mysql. running *
Can you locate the error-logfile for mysql and post it in pastebin?
that is under var ?
No, is the mysql server running on your system?.  Yes, but check first if the server is running
no the service is not running and I can not get it to start
kk, then paste the errorlog.  It should be under /var/log/mysql/error.log
you want the whole thing or tail ?
Paste all of it in pastebin :)
is it possible to get rid of unused softwares easily?
in the software manager you can remove the software you don't need.  start here [URL]
thanks
samanathon: if you have lenghty pastes, you should use [URL]
Yes --- I booted into an ubuntu live CD and everything works. So that rules out hardware failure of any kind
buggy drivers then, maybe
thanks. but first I need to see what a file is set at.. from there I can make the change I need and then change it back to what it was.
ls -la will show what it's set at, .  if you do ls -la, paste the rwx.. values, i'll tell you what number it is.. you can go from there
thanks.. ls -l also seems to report the values.. -rw-r--r-.  766?
yep :)
:_. :))
now check that link i pasted, it'll help explain how it all comes together.
k
hang on . that's 644
doesn't seem to work for me, tried shift, alt, ctrl
otherwise you could click the popupblocker icon thingy and choose it to not block that site
i think that allows all popups for that URL, i just want to temporarily allow one pop-up
sorry no idea then, maybe they just made it that way =/
yet i don't have that package...
make sure you spell it correctly :)
that's what copy and paste is for ;)
then don't forget to remove the trailing ':'
it sucks :P
There's a tool to bring them back to a normal place, I just don't remember what. Probably ubuntu-tweak
gonna look into it, thank you. i don't see any valid reason to place notifications anywhere else than in a corner :)
Ubuntu devs reserved the corner for "VERY important" notifications
i'd also like to have the app come to front when clicking on them as that's intentional behaviour, instead of clicking throug them.
i.e. volume change things xD
that's somewhat stupid, if you ask me. a huge usability fail
I know
some kind of mouse configurations are set stupidly?
<unconvertable>  use path tool to draw a line its easy <unconvertable> :)
Well I dont have to do that in windows and I cant use Path Tool when digital drawing can I?. how can I lower my DPI that may work?
<unconvertable>  i thought u r trying simple lines
xset m 1 1 Is it possible to make it lower than 1 1?.  I wouldnt go so far to ask in her just to draw a simple line I want to draw things that takes hours with brush tool
<unconvertable>  sorry i m not familiar with digital drawing
woops. yeah. pardon me
tried Synaptic?
i have a bootable disk...won't that work ?
the create a virtual space for it. then mount it. it iwll. will
yes
Also, is you AMsn from the repo of downloaded and compiled?
downloaded and compiled.. the repo is about a year old.
Have you removed it and removed 8.5, reinstall tk 8.5 and then reinstall AMSN?
i tried doing tk, i'll try tcl too
Normally, TK and TCL are almost tied together...
nope, removed them with --purge and then reinstalled, still says 8.3.5 :(.  not only this, after purging tcl-8.5, i still have tclsh. so it appears i have another TCL installation somehow, although i really don't know how i ended up with it
What version of Ububtu (Hardy?)
hardy x64
You can have several version at the same time
oh, how do i kill the old one?
Good, same a me, can you open Synatic?
synaptics gives me
I have no really good idea, bit in the meantime you could try to change the update server you are using. *but
sure anything
went fine, but after the attempt to format/partion everything went to HELL.  sorry.  [URL]
yea.. I"ve thought of that.. but ultimately I'd like to burn to a dvd for relatives
picasa makes that pretty painless.. don't think you'll get videos though
no, I have a drive I can devote now, and in the next few days move 2 drives into the array
aah. I've been using btrfs, which (for me) has been the easiest way to deal with this. Can add extra drives/partitions at will. Although someone on here mentioned there is a bug in btrfs rebalancing on the current Wily kernel, so maybe not a great idea right now
yea, I have 3x drives, 1 was pairity and the other 2 are xfs; these came from unRAID and I'm switching to ubuntu
you need to keep xfs?
no, but I need to keep the data, so I was going to use 1 drive and move the data over 1 drive at at time.. *at a.  currenlty I put LVM on the <was parity> disk and can migrate data to the new LVM, however don't know how I would do parity from that. unRAID uses separate xfs partitioned drives and somehow creates a parity drive (I don't think it technically uses a RAID)
well, if btrfs is stable enough for you (and RAID5 on btrfs is _almost_ stable) it makes this kind of thing easy. You could migrate from flat format to RAID1 to RAID5 in easy increments, without the complexity of LVM etc. I'm afraid it is so long since I had to mess about with LVM or mdraid I forget how to do this otherwise.  but I'm probably just pushing my favoured way on to you
I think I understand LVM enough, but it doesn't have parity options (that I know of); I would mostly use the drives for media storage w/a small handful of VMs running on it that I would prefer to be highly available.... I liked how unRAID made it easy to have a redundant array, but it would seemingly boot completely, wait 6min, then *finally* start booting the VMs...
to be honest, I've come to the conclusion that RAID is more hassle than it is worth with the multi-terabyte drives I have in my desktop these days. I've abandoned it for bcache and rotational backups. Rebuilding an array is just a pain
yea, that's what I'm thinking (hence me being hesitant to jump on a RAID); I do have this data in an offsite location that I very loosely sync with; I would like to do a parity, ideally fs independent and non RAID; but I guess I could be asking too much...
maybe. I'd be interested in your eventual soultion, so please ping me and let me know what you end up doing
i did .. "mount|grep hdb" gives me no output
paste your /etc/fstab to pastebin?
i don't see u in #pastebin

Ram and CPU please, also any GPU. opening now
16GB RAM
thats alot of ram, is the CPU i386 or 64bit?. (link not wanting to open)
64Bit
Alright, what type of CPU? like, whats the name of it?
Intel <unconvertable> CoreTM i7 6700HQ Processor,.  NVIDIA <unconvertable> GeForce <unconvertable> GTX 960M
...thats not bad.. the onlything i THINK may be an issue is the GPU but that shouldnt be a problem.... try CTRL+ALT+F1 and try that
did u follow a particular guide?
No. It's an R300, it's supposed by the open source drivers..  The 9800, I suspect, probably isn't an R300?
how can i find out?
Google.. Unless you boot of the windows installer CD.. That does. :). Such as?. Windows can't read Linux partitions, so other than the MBR, there isn't anyhting for it.. It does not do that.
[URL]ng has it as a R350 NH
Then it's not supported.
i do have drivers installed. fglrx
Those do not support AIGLX.. And likely never will.. Heh.
=(
You can use xgl though.. Which is different from AIGLX.
the xorg-driver-fglrx is not open source??
No. It's ATI's propriatary drive.
ic
The "radeon" driver is open source, and has recent support for full acceleration on R300 and below.. But not yet above.. So, with an R300, it "Just Works"
got u
Obviously guys are working hard to make it work with yoru card, but ya know, it's closed stuff. It's very hard. ;)
any trustworthy guides for the 9800 card?
I suspect any Xgl guide can do it fo ryou.. It's the same then.
what does OSS stands for?
open source software.  or open source system.  or probably 400 other things
ok. lol
open sound system
read again. that's the other way around
Well you can't connect a unix socket between machines. If it is possible, it would have to be over some other transport
Well I'm really new to linux, so I haven't a clue to what that is
if you want to change your resolution it is in system settings->displays
2.6.15-26.  -386
hmm... that should work. only 2.6.17 has a typo in it that busts saa 7134 support.  what do dmesg and lspci say?
lspci says nothing about it since it disappeared, and dmesg doesn't say any interesting stuff other than that oci interrupt thingy.  I'll just paste it at pastebin to see if you can find anything I can't
but it worked before? ... card broken? try different pci-slot... firmware issues?
perhaps card broken, I hope not. I'll try a different pci-slot.  [URL]
you're right, nothing remarkable in there, except the total absence of the card being noticed
okay. What did you mean by firmware issues?
some cards need a firmware uploaded to them at boot to function properly. But this is not the case with you, you'd get a notice in dmesg
okay, I'll try a different pci slot then.  I'll be back in a reboot
c u
no luck :(
so you had it working before?
what is it?
/join # blackbuntu #ipcop. so on. what kinda firewall ?. extrenel internel ?
But If I uncheck that one, will icons be visible for USB, external HD etc. ?
nope, they will probabably disappear too
Ok, you don't know any other way? In the earlier version I think it helped to mount the volumes in any other place then /media, but now it seems like it doesn't work anymore..
I thought only stuff in /media showed but I may be wrong
?
What's the name of your file manager?
I am using the default file manager of Ubuntu 13.10. I dont know the name, Is it nautilus? idk. Also I can't right click :P.  how to reinstall the default file manager?
sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus
i don't see why not, it isn't essential
have you tried Force Version?
no i haven't, how do you do that?
Package -> Force Version...
see whenever i login in ybuntu there are many error messeges like this. help me with vlc also
that's not an error message
When I try to mount it, it says there is not valid NTFS partition..  even when using disk utility as root
okay can you please execute 'fdisk -l.  and pastebin it
how to install this version
go to the website and select the deb package for ubuntu
on web the beta version is available
there are no stable versions, only a beta
can you tell me how can i install from command line
sudo gdebi [URL]b
i know i've move a folder into /bin and i dont want it there. sorry
make double sure you dont do anything wrong. you have been warned :)
it failed. Error on GPG
did you add any 3rd party repositories?
I did. I explicitly told GPARTED to delete it.
cup_holder:what are u using now ?. <unconvertable>  simply format it then
But I did that. It's as if there's some sort of ghost of an old operating system in my hard drive, eternally haunting it..  How can I get my disk back to the state when I bought it? Just delete the partitions, or must I do more than that?
<unconvertable>  wipedisk and similar, google is your friend. !ask
hmm, who does those two things connect?.  if i "touch somefile" than "somefile" as Owner in "file properties" have " - Samba guest account"
a file that's in a samba share, or not?
where ever i create file under this user
in ~/ ?
what is that
Do a google search KVM windows ubuntu.  KVM is a virtualization environment. It will allow you to run windows, virtually, inside of ubuntu
145 gigs free.  it also hangs on stop
Hmm... Any output when you start it manually as in "sudo service rsyslogd start"?
that i could look at
yes.. let me find it
What happens if i try to resize it and make a partition that is too small for the exsisting data?
The only problems might occur if you get a power cut halfway through or something, but the same goes for anything HD related like defragging too.  Good luck doing that, it won't let you
but it displays many unnecessary lines.  i need it for a shell script
are the extra lines errors?
and then?
- 192.168.1.1 most likely - ifconfig to find out... login and there should be options to configure port forwarding..  - do you use netgear? linksys? what kind of router?
I ask because I keep getting apt-get install errors when I do that. and it can't verrify the package source or something like that
Must be some GPG keys that you haven't installed, for some added repos perhaps
when the new card is the only card it won't let me configure anything. my current card is the one that has been here since the install
iwconfig or ifconfig wlan0
yeah but I would like something with more finesse
databridge_: do you have desktop effects enabled?. oops wrong person
Thank you for explaining..  Does your enumeration include wall?
wall is not a damon
its to danm confusing
and django_ has a point, -vv is VERBOSE.  but -vv is good...
is a dram controler a sound card
not that I know of, just run lspci (without the -vv)
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 01). what of that should i google to get the driver
do :: lsmod |grep sound
soundcore 10208 1 snd
ok, can you open alsamixer in a terminal?
the proprietary ATI FGLRX driver
It should support the randr extension afaik.. you might want to check 'xrandr'.  You may have to explicitly tell it to enable the output since it probably won't detect your tv being plugged through the VGA adapter
do you know a walkthrough on how to do that? not sure I'd know how
[URL]
thanks, I'll go read and give that a shot
You'll need the output enabled with an appropriate mode. There's no guarantee it will work
u using wine to play it?
native install
nopr. no
you might need to load the live cd again and then do a repair console...then you could try typing update-grub
how do i do that. ?
put the cd back in the drive and reboot...when it comes up there will be a choice for a recover console or something like that
i already looked for that but i dont see a recover console
you could just try reinstalling as it sounds like grub was not loaded anyways
i tryd two times. and it gave me the same error
does it give you that error when you reboot or during install?
during install. more precisely in the end
are you using a raid array?
????. what is it exactly. ?
do you have one hard drive?
yes. but i have already partitioned the hard drive
ok, do you think that the cd might be bad..its possible its not able to read from it when installing grub...could you reburn?
thank you  let me see. it worked  thank you
cool
: lol, yeah, i know. ill just wait for their next driver release, nvidia is good about fixing problems quickly, even if they just affect one distro
the libc6 dependency effects everybody I can think of but FC3 and gentoo...

what about that?. :D
Oh ok that does make it dificult

Okie dokies, hope someone can help..... i just installed smart launcher on my 3650, how do i get more skins??? i mean i have some but im using a MMC card reader and i dont know how to get them working.. can someone help?
your on your own there
they are
they wouldnt be.. when you boot your on tty1 by default.. X starts on tty7
that is what I want.
dude thats what it IS
done
sudo dpkg -P privoxy ; sudo aptitude -y install privoxy
I get the exact same error
add "set -x" (no quotes) as the second line of /var/lib/dpkg/info/privoxy.postinst, then rnu the above commands again, and paste the output to #flood
oh man, when your installer says Ack!. you're screwed. I pasted my privoxy stuff,
sure you edited the postinst script correctly?
yep. first line is set -s. second line is set -x. should I get rid of "set -e"?
no.  what does "head /var/lib/dpkg/info/privoxy.postinst" print?
"link layer"?. and where do i assign a static ip?
try #ip link
was that supposed to do anything?
it lists all your interfaces
it didnt list anything
on the link layer, for example, my line on wlan0 says: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
ok i've got
does it say they interface is up?
no-carrior,broadcast,multicast,up>
the wireless link isn't up then
em then how do i put it up
when you type 'sudo iwconfig' does it show a MAC address next to "Access Point:"?
yes
then try: ip link set wlan0 up.  i like the ip command more than ifconfig, ifconfig is a wrapper on the ip command, and i find the original easier
well ok. but i still have the problem lol
does 'ip link' show the interface as 'UP' now?
<No-carrier,broadcast,multicast,up>. ^no change from what it was
that no-carrier think basically means that the 'cable is unplugged'.  there's no link.  what's the signal strength? (Link Quality under iwconfig)
0. oh shit. all my stuff was removed. one sec. Link Quality:0. but under nmap applet - my router is shown. with a connection
Did you set up your wireless interface in System -> Administration -> Network?
the suspend works, the resume no
if you don't suspend, you don't have to resume
but I can suspend
ok, then don't resume
but I must resume
but it doesn't work
if I suspend.  it resume, but bad. *resumes
so don't
frogzoo yes and then?
soz - maybe under power preferences
thanks
no prob
huh?.  there's no RDP client for linux?
packagename: tightvnc.  tightvnc.. !
ok. I see
then u have to install tightvnc for xp too.. google "tightvnc windows" and its done
oh no.  i thought tightvnc could connect to the xp rdp server :s
u want to connect to a xp server? then use ssh
i want to connect to RDP server on XP. from linux
yes.. openssh
openssh?
yes
how?
install openssh and then "ssh -l user <IP>"
I need a graphical user interface
or just "ssh name@domain"
no, how would i check for a kernel update?, and not that i know of
it just comes as a update with synaptics/apt
no updates
overheating?
This computer hasn't even been on for an hour, i just got restarted 10 minutes ago
did you happen to follow a how to guide prior to this happening?
of what sort?
any kind
no
sorry but i'm out of ideas
ah it's quite alright
except some person who had access to your pc and wrote a script as a prank
but how does update-grub know not to "generate the menu.lst"?
i don't know much about it, but it does the biz.
cause the manual says first time you run it i generates the list.  then "The user must set the two options update-grub uses. Then re-run the update-grub script to update the menu.lst file using the default's that have been set".  So I wanna know its not gonna generate the list. I want it just to update with my additions.
you can trust the manual more than me
=)
try without doing it, see if your changes have been applied
well I havnt run it once yet. Surly you have to run it at least once. I did with lilo
give it a try :) grub works differently to lilo
it just says "not a dynamic executable"
what does 'file' say about it?
server_linux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped.  I can read the file fine, I just can't run it
read it?.  its a binary...
like with vim and cat. I can see that its there, and the data
and uname -a?
Yeah i know that but thats for hardy . i dont want to compile it i want the old gutsy deb
was it ever made for gutsy? Compiling it is not really that difficult either, and then you can build your own deb for it
it ran fine with 8.04
I just upgraded to the 64 bit 1.04. <- what is 1.04
sorry, the newest version of Ubuntu
you could try [URL]
have you removed the man pages?. that is ~20
no
thats ~20 mb
thats crazy lol
why?
20 mb of man pages?
how do i ? :). How do i create extended partition ?. ubottu: Extended partitions. !extended
What OS are you using?
thx
hmm
hmm? point?
what happends? join #ubuntu+1 for lucid support
I just did
yah
Yep (fancy meeting you again!)
to untar it, do tar xvzf <filename>
Do i download it first then?.  When i tried before it just opened it in the file roller
yes, downoad it to somewhere comfortable like your homw directory, then do the command on it in a terminal.  the file roller can do the same thing.  it just "unzips" it (or untars it if you prefer). "extract here" is the same deal from the context menu. (right click)
thankyou :) what is currentkernel ?
type uname -a in terminal to see what kernel you are using.  i think driver you downloaded was for 2 5 22. 2 6 22
orly? wonder how that got there :/. is there a simple command to purge a ppa?
your mother probably was playing it.. :D
i have but there are no tools for rewriting the mbr, short of reinstalling and i'd rather not do that
i'm playing with webimn ... but can't login. It say i need the root pwd but on ubuntu it dosn't exist ... any idea ?.  try with live, chroot the root of your li. chroot and do a grub-install
you've lost me. chroot?.  you mean, download the live cd?.  what does "chroot the root of your li" mean?
u don't own any cd with linux on it ?. if u own a fedora cd boot it into rescue mode and follow on screen info
i have a Ubuntu cd, several Mandrake cds and a Knoppic cd. *knoppix
use mandrake... i think they have the rescue option
Mandrake doesn't use GRUB. so i don't see what good that would do
from 9 mndrake use grub.. but isn't so important. u need to get into system
MDK 9 doesn't use GRUB
than mount your linux root and issue chroot <mount point>. u will have a virtual root filesystem to use .
then what?
when u have it u can do a grub-install .
how can i do a grub-install when grub isn't available on the mandrake disk?
when u chroot u got the ubuntu system.
ok. i guess i'll give it a try
it's so easy doing it than explain ... *grin*
but will it redetect my windows install?
grub-install reinstall the grub with the file that reside on disk ... (i think) :)
but the file on disk isn't working?!?!. i mean, isn't that why grub won't come up?. i'm confused
i lost the point .... try in that way. if the file is invalid grub will generate a new one. imho
how can i do so
did you add a ppa, if so which one?
how can i do so...because i am getting only option for export ...in password and encryption application
which ppa did you add?.  which ppa did you add?
vlc. do u know better?
ah, there you have to use "open file" and click the subtitle button and choose the subtitle file
i want to be able to see it in the boot menu and load into it so i can use it
only the partition(s) that will have a boot loader installed needs to have the boot flag set...
so that would mean only my windows vista partition...right>
it's usually only the first partition on the first disk
so if you had more than one computer acting as the web serving it will be able to process faster?
oh. that's load distributions.  there's several ways to do that... the easiest to round-robin DNS
does that mean every computer has a mirror of the files on the server?
basically.  you setup a couple of machines with exactly the same document root.  then you setup DNS with multiple A records.  like:. www A 192.168.0.1. www A 192.168.0.2. and then randomly, when people go to [URL] they'll go to one machine or the other
yep
there are a lot more advanced methods too that might work out better for you
how would that work with reading and writing to mysql databases
as long as you use a single database and the webservers themselves are stateless, you're fine.  things like phpbb, for example, are fine
so all the htdocs and mysql database are on one machine, but the others link to it?
you can make multiple copies of static content and scripts.  but you need a single database
lol i love my crappy iphone :P .. which web interface is that for VLC?... care to share it with me :D
its in VLC already just enable it
VLC|| Tools > Preferences >> ?????
theres also this for rhythmnbox [URL]  there are guides all over, i havent done it for ages ut it does exits.  [URL]
lol after that youtube video i might need glasses... but i think i found it :D
it shows what to do.  you can then install a vlc remote app on your phone and control stuff
yep thats what iam talking about
i dont think theres any left handed shape cursors in by default. try gnome-look or similar site they have cursors. look under x11-cursors
alright, thank you in advance! :). There's a question left, how to i install the packages i get from gnome-[URL] do*
make a folder called .icons in /home and put it in there. im not sure if you can install cursors from the appearance menu. osmetimes you can just click the tar.gz file and itll do it by itself. from the appearance menu
There's no right click menu. Nothing happens when I right click, I should say
Oh, my bad, I'm not in Unity. I believe that you can't customize the indicators in Unity natively.

Have you tried ****-****-** with your encryption key
I don
I don?. what does that mean?
don't quite understand what yuo mean by ****-***-***. typo sorrie dude.  sorry that was a typo earlier. Redeyess: I dont quite understans what you mean by ****-***-**.  can you please explain. gouki: you there?
the key should be in the format " ****-****-** ". after each 4 digits/letters there should be a dash
I just enter my key under system->admin->networking and it doesn't give the option of a specific format. Redeyess: but I can't seem to get to ping the router. both amber and green LED's flash on the card

you have any experience with grive? I've installed it, generated the token but the app itself is nowhere

I wish I could help, but I have no experience with those.

though,some users in the channels might have jobs with some big companies
I can't find it in the color profile (at least in the preferences window). There's 3 categories: text colors (foreground, background), marking text (foreground, background) and interface colors (new data, marker line, new message, away user, highlight). Which one of those do I change to change my user text? Or is there an .xchatrc sort of file I need to edit?
its the text colors. Interface > colors > text colors (find the one you need to change and change it).  its the text colors. Interface > colors > text colors (find the one you need to change and change it)
Which option under 'text colors' do I change? I'm looking at the window right now and nothing says anything that even implies my own personal user text? I can't figure out what to change
look at this screenshot. If you dont see this, then you either are not looking in the right spot or are not using XChat (XChat Gnome isnt the same) -- [URL] -- change one of those
which one of those? do you know?
this isnt difficult. Just find the one that looks like the color the text is now and change it. if you change the worng one, just change it back. This isnt difficult.
thank you

wine/cedega?
is there a way i can check without booting into it again?
Not really, but wait a bit first. You could try loading ide_generic first, I think that might catch it..  But i dont know how to make it do that automatically..  blacklisting piix in your initram should work, but I think you just tried that. :s
is that a package? is it GUI? website?
it is a gui
ok. just empty. ?
no, it's a locked account.
just A. thus, the problem. it is still recognizing A As A shortcut for some reAson.
I mean what was the thing you set 'a' to ?
oh. Uhm... ring switcher, next window (All workspAces)
run gconf-editor, navigate the tree on the left to /apps/compiz/plugins/switcher/allscreens/options , you should find it in the panel on the right. When you do, right click it and select unset key
problem: I've AlreAdy unset the shortcut. It still won't let me hAve my key bAck.
in gconf-editor?
gconf-editor shows thAt i've unset the key... it dosen't show the shortcut for 'A' Anymore.
bummer.
though, i suppose i could get used to hitting shift A lot... though, i'll hAve to explAin my strAnge cApitAlizAtion rules...
have you restarted compiz (silly question maybe, but gotta start somewhere :)
nope ...  gnome
oh, ok
why does it matter ? i wont it to run as a daemon before gnome even starts anyway ..
oh, ok that makes it easier (never really used gnome).  you can create a init script
where should i place it ?
there should be a file called /etc/init.d/skeleton.  it's a template what it should look like
i see... once i create it, where should i place it ?
put it in /etc/init.d
aight thanks ! :)
and in /etc/rc3.d should be a link to it called "S99script".  then it will be executed at last when the system enters runlevel 3.  /etc/rc#.d are the other runlevels
but as I said, i would like to remove them from my computer. I dont want those items filling up extra space. i want to remove from computer, not just menu
i'm unsure if that is a good idea.. you'll have to get other advice.
whats that
Nintendo emulator...
I do not know this identifier. Where should I try this?
sorry, i thought you were setting the viewport via compiz rule, but i see now it's a devilspie file .. excuse
I do not use Compiz.
ok, my mistake
its local
so, local like "intranet" or liike "file" ?
thanks for advice, but why not?.  already beta 2 :)
if you can't figure out how to upgrade - you shouldn't be using beta software
you even don't know how I am using it, how can you judge? :)
becuse you don't know how to upgrade
okm someone else will help me than, no problem :)

Windows is more particular about where it can be installed, if you've used all your primary partitions with Linux, for instance, the Windows boot loader will be a problematic install. [URL]
I was planning on installing it on a separate harddrive..  think windows would have an issue with that?
Read that page I gave the link for, it explains what I'm talking about, I sited the subsection of the document that I thought might be most helpful to you.
thanks

ok, thank you :) (what is universe though, old software?)
Kholerabb1: more software that is not officially supported
: yes

is it binary safe?
it doesn't care whether it's a binary or text
Nope, is that what needs to be done?
Yes
yes
done:)
I had an ntfs drive that I formated to fat32. Now i need to edit fstab and Im not sure what to put in the drives line. if it was an ext3 I would put /dev/hdb1 /drive2 ext3 defaults 0 1 but for fat 32 im not sure...
just look at /dev/hde1.  that's a fat32 partition
oh right...hehe thanks
np:)
no
do you have saved passwords that you care about ? anything saved in firefox ?
that seems to be happy. Can I assume everything is ok then?
yes, oneiric is a hybrid image: [URL]  no. it depends on the actual error you got.  what kernel do you currently run?
kll
in which folder are they?
what i do? should i just delet them from documents. home
which folder exactly?
home < .macromdia<Flash_Player<#ShareObjects<BNQGUFPL
that are temorary internet files from the flash plugin
so I dont have to erase them?
you dont need to.
Ok
but if you like, you can erase them.
thnk you kll. they dont take a lot of space of my memory?
i dont know. right click on the files and see yourself
hmm?. [URL]
not released yet
and holding? because it sometimes heads well into the two hundreds...
not too much had a look on it
what are those, do you know?
Thumbnails are tiny images that give you a preview of what is contained in a file. GNOME Nautilus uses them for pictures.
thank you.
!enter
i'm installing the bastille security package on ubuntu
sorry, no knowledge her about that :-/
sorry transmission
As long as you can mount the location using Places>Connect to server or using 'mount', then you should be able to set that as a destination location in transmission.
so how do I get my NIC working
sudo apt-get install linux-firmware may do it. !ics.  could also extract the deb and put the firmware file in /lib/firmware that way you get the file but don't have the debian package stinking up your packages
heello. seems like my intrid doesnt have the drives to see my drives.  can u help with my issue
what is wrong?
the system wide PATH i would like to add a directory which contains my binary
which directory? Why not put the binary somewhere it's supposed to go?
because it is my binary ... ~/code/myprogram
Right, if you want to run it, for yourself, just use ./programname, if youre looking to make it available for everyone, put it in /usr/local/bin
checking.  /dev/hdc1 1 38913 312568641 83 Linux.  I missed the 1!. I think its mounted, checking
:-)
Yep! Free Space: 278.3 GB. Now to get it into fstab =)
nice size
Thanks, preparing to clear out a windows box with 6 drives (Collecting the data to one drive).  When I browse it through nataulis I can't create a folder or file (Right clicking)
how does fstab list it?
/dev/hdc /media/320gb auto 0 0.  Am I missing rw?
try this ... /dev/hdc1 /mnt/newdrive ext3 defaults 0 0 .... whatever u want to call mount point and better under mnt than media as that is where removables typically get mounted.  get the correct spaces in that line!
/dev/hdc1 /media/320gb auto defaults 0 0 (This is a temporary mount to move 250gbs of data).  I missed ext3
http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
Ok, I am going to try to reboot. I've checked (http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]) and did a mount -a but I still cant make a folder in it. I think maybe rebooting this might do the trick.
reboot shouldn't be necessary mount -a will reread the fstab
ok.  I wonder if its simple permmissions?
yep
Thats what it is =)
on the mnt/...
yes, so I'll chown to nobody?. or.. lol wait.  Is there something I should be doing other than chown'ing to nobody? Or should I chown it to
why chown at all? give write permissions to all. you want all users to be able to write to it, no?
Ok, I am unsure how to go about that. I know, simple question.  yes
man chmod
thx.  lol, got it =).  fstab made me forget 5 years of linux.  Thank you for the help!, all is working.
fine, :-)
string.h
thats a header
ok and what's that an header ?
yes, thats a header
ikoni, but what is it ?
a header file.  what are you trying to do ?
oh, thanks
reboot is needed only for kernel upgrade
i need to reboot manual ? or like a windows reboot self
manualy
oh thanks man. if i use a proxy, can update my linux ?
if your proxy allow them, yes.  just need to configure apt to use proxy
secure ???
?
Ok, thanks
(generally)
in the older versions it was under view.  I want it always there.
oh OK - well I only use "browser mode" ( actually I prefer rox filer anyway )
@oerheks thanks I didn't add the destination.
have fun
k, anyhow I copied the text from the link and pasted it into the etc/net/interfaces file (deleting what was previously there), was that what I was supposed to do?
it would have been better to back the old one up, but it can be traced back no problem, the one i pasted for you will disable eth0, so if it doesnt work, make sure the eth0 line is set to dhcp and doesnt start with # and then restart networking to get eth0 back
well i can connect with ssh , but cant use vnc
what vnc server? is it running?
well i see it has "remote desktop viewer" and
are you logged into ubuntu?
well both machiens are xubuntu and yes , i am logged to both of them
any error message on the vnc client?
well as soon as i click connect i get "connection to host was closed"
firewall running on that machine? how are the two machines commected?. connected*
just curious, im building that system in a day or so and was considering ubuntu as my OS. probably the 8.04 beta until the official release
it runs quite well on it. I don't have the box you have, but a friend of mine does. Runs fast ..
good to hear, its been a while since i ran linux on new hardware so i was afraid it may not work
you should be good :-)
sorry, do you mean my IP?. not sure what "remote" ip is
no.. the other end of the network connection.  or you mean your torrent program is uploading to someone to fast?
oh, that's interesting
Now on my "good" laptop Encription Key is also off which connects to the WPA2 only AP.
other wifi chipset maybe.  how it worked before ?
it worked with all computers before with the WPA/WPA2 setting.
i see
Now I think my router somehow "hated" my MAC since the upgrade, and in the process when I rebooted the router maybe it reset itself..
you have broadcom ?
I did not want to disturb others, as for them the internet worked (only this one laptop was excluded)..  It is an "ADB" router, the ISP sent it.
no, i mean the wifi card
lspci says: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6235 (rev 24) (It is in an acer travelmate.)
zyki have a remote server which I just have shell access to.  sorry, that post was for you ^^
"apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop" to confirm the package is installed. then perhaps, "ps aux | grep X" to confirm Xorg is running?
I see nothing from grep
maybe "sudo service lightdm status"?
sorry i don't understand you
you want a function that will read your text file and split each newline as an array element for your for loop
yes.  but this isn't the same than for i in `cat dictionary.txt` in bash ?
so use like f = open('dictionary.txt').readlines()
and that will remove packages that arent needed
yes
even thgouh i try mp3blaster -s=/dev/dsp *.mp3 or dsp1
don't have alsa?
ill try that, alsamixer adjusts volume so i guess i do.  i installed opencubicplayer but am unsure on how to launch it
ocp *.mp3
well, it's not quite that simple. when you install ubuntu, you have to give it a user name and their details, a hostname, and other things. if you blindly copy the VM file, that's a start, but you then need to go in and change all that stuff. I've never messed around with mass-deployments of ubuntu, so I am sure there must be a better way
Ahh, I see. Don't really have experience in that area, so I can't help you.
i really dont feel like doing that. =/
Make a final /important/ backup then "do-release-upgrade -d" -- Not too hard. :)
will post to pastebin.  http://paste.ubuntu-[URL]
seems like a cdemu problem or a problem with the .bin. however this doesn't need to be a problem though.  but [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/cdemu3' is. try startig cdemu with sudo
I did
you did successfully load the kernel module,  ?
yes.... but let me check something
ls -alF /dev/cdemu*
I will have to pastebin the results
sure, go on
i did a standard install with the 10.04 server cd. I used the installer to setup raid+lvm. no manual installation of anything.  i wasn't able to boot in the system after the installer completed.  by holding the shift key I got in the grub2 (1.98) menu, the configuration appears to be valid (insmod raid5, raid5rec, mdraid,lvm,ext2).  and my root partition (no separate boot) is ext4
hmm... this can be bug... but now I would try to boot from live cd, chroot into installed system, try to install raid and lvm utils, update initramfs and reboot
can I do that with the server cd? or do I need the desktop cd?
I think that server cd should bu sufficient
rescue mode?
try it... if it boot into terminal it will be good :)
it just doesn't seem to load raid+lvm in the terminal :(
hmm, md devices doesn't exist? :/
no
try modprobe raid1 (or raidX according to level...)
oh. there is md0
vgscan should map lvm devices
false positive, the md0 says "no such file or directory" (if i triy mdadm --start /dev/md0).  vgscan gives no output aparat from "this may take a while"
look in fdisk if partition types are raid auto detect...
sSS , i checked and nothing is muted
me id go with 12.04 as i know that one properly supports it. it should be working. have you installed the AMD proprietary drivers? if so remove em
It is not mounted; it's not listed under mount
how are you mounting it?
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt.  I've tried mounting it to different folders
k, no problems there, the most common cause is an unclean windows shutdown. rebooting to windows and shutting it down again should fix that..  there might be something helpfull in dmesg, dmesg | tail to view the last few lines
Well that would be great and all if I could get it to show up in grub.  nothing in dmesg either
ah yeah, grub kind of needs windows to be mountable for it to be included by grub. at least, the autoconfigure of grub does
i'm on kubuntu and don't use synaptic , any CLI ?
can be done on cli but not sure how
thanks anyway =)
bad wetaher too
nope, just USB devices and PCI devices
and it is builtin or isa?
nothing besides that joke
heh
eg: install-cube.sh -i want include the icon in the menu. orbi: i want using the scritp install.sh include the icons from cube in the menu (aplication->game), how i doing this?
my guess is you need to find out where the menu launchers are kept and put the new one in there
yes i did
k, give me a second.  Look at this: [URL] and the first comment below it :)
sudo lspci
Try [URL]  Working?
no
is there some other usb drive which didn't used to be there?
it loads the internal sdcard, and the keyboard from there. I tried to blacklist usbhid and usb_storage, but they are reloaded again though..  in the last ubuntu version, it worked.
is the sd card your boot drive?
no.
what happens if you insert the sd after the braille line has loaded?
if I remove the sdcard, I get the same error with usbhid..  instead of usb_storage
I'm not familiar with braille lines, is there any configuration for it to make it not care about needing configuration 1?
no. brltty cannot access the braille line for some reason.
do you have a brand and model for this braille line?
c251:1124
I can't seem to find any products using the id number of c251:1124. Could be a usb cable or controller giving corrupted data
[URL]  actually, the device is recognized.  it just seems that the other drivers "claim" it, so brltty (which uses libusb) cannot use it.
this looks like a bug in libusb, not so easy to correct..  is there any way for you to use a non-usb keyboard?
well, there is no /proc/bus/usb/, and I cannot create it ...
a non-usb keyboard could work around the hid problem
the braille line has an integrated sd-card and keyboard..  so this is not an option.
in that case, it is definitely a problem in libusb
i think so. how do i check
mine is mini9, sometimes unity not working here
its some uname option right. sorry i havent tuoched linux in years
i thought you are running ubuntu in your mini9
ok thats not working
although id add a --no-act at first
--no-act ?. whats that
puts the op through a dry run to see if there will be errors
seveas ya
what does 'file filename.tbz' say?
XML-Parser-2.34.tar.gz. seveas XML-Parser-2.34.tar.gz
there are tons of xml parsers in the repositories...
was that you who fixed the automatix factoid?
yes
that's a QT app right?
yea, you need the kde libs.
I don't play KDE :)
but trust me, you'll fall in love with it..  your loss :-P just need the libs ..
you could of just told me gftp
why on earth? i have even no idea if it's "good".
come again? :D
- use awk to select the first column from the who output, put that through uniq and you get the unique users on the system
but if I use the "users" command will that not do the same thing?
users lists the current users laterally.  users lists the current users laterally.  I get two instaces of rich
so It's not the same thing... hmm we didn't see awk though nor did we see unique :/
who | awk '{print $1}' | uniq.  - just shows rich
users | awk '{print $1}' | uniq just shows  ;)
- i believe thats the desired result
so that still doesn't solve my question what the difference is :D.  between who and users :D
- to check, i would create a new user, use ctrl alt f1 to open tty1, log in with the other user, and run the cmd again
have it isntalled, turned most off, and it still does for some reason, can't find the setting :| and the effect keeps glitching out and so ugly
I'm trying to figure out what plugin does it, but the plugin names aren't very logical
that's why I came here :)
I'd figure it'd be 'notification' ... but it's options don't look too promising... 'gconf-editor' /apps/compiz/ it's somewhere there, heh
I have the ubuntu 11.04 server install can't find /media/cdrom issue
during the install it can't find /media/cdrom ?
yeah need to ln -s /cdrom /media/cdrom
don't think you do
it's a known bug
under what circumstacnces
[URL]
if it's a known bug can you give me the bug id.  perfect, thank you.  just alt F2/F3 keys to get a terminal
during the install?
pretty much as soon as the kernel has booted for the installer
cheers i'll try it
that should be enough time to get a terminal
looks all good - thanks for the help
nice job
hmmm, no fails again same thing.  if i ls /media/cdrom it sees the cd files.  could i use mnt or something?
sorry, I missed the question,
it failed - took longer than i thought - same thing, even though i'd linked cdrom to media/cdrom.  so instead of symlinking could i mount it there?
no
cool
if the symlink doesn't work, mounting won't.  if you did ls -la /cdrom you could see the files correctly ?
it's final version?
well,if you have updated ubuntu 9.04 then yes
i ahve xubuntu 9.04
should be 3.5.12
have*. xD
jjust go to about window in ff and check what it says
i have a 3.0.14 mozilla
its final and latest
Well the general public releases can and do break my system, so it can't be much worse..  I haven't been able to successfully run any kernel past .16.
believe me it can. i loosed firefox and [URL] together with my languiage support for two days
I clicked on Theme Details. I only see Controls, Icons tab
there should be a window border and an icon tab there
All I see is Controls, Icons tabs
odd. I have the three I described ( this is in gnome on 6.06 )
same here I got latest ubuntu build.  I wonder why I dono't have the window tab :S.  problem after problem
does the window border tab show on other themes?
no
hmm - dunno then - sounds like the theme function is broken for some reason
:s I don't know how to fix it
hang on a second.  try sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-control-center
okay
that appears to be the package that contains gnome-theme-manager
yes
have the precise model number?
how could I fix the issue?
I don't know, but it doesn't sound like an ubuntu problem (necessarily) if some plugin is buggy
yeah and it's giving me a lot of headache
I have a silly question, why do you need to recompile it to work with zend ?
I'm running php with fpm and zend server doesn't support fpm.  so my php5 install crashes everytime because of this
ok, so I have a solution you may find easier, but also sloppier.  how "professional" do you want to be I guess it depends on the purpose of this machine)
the purpose of the machine is a build server
ok - this "may" be acceptable to you
running jenkins, subversion, java, python
have you considered building a php install in /opt (for example) to run zend again. keep it totally isolated from your machine machine. sorry, main file system
yeah I'm considering it, but how to modify the php5 source files is my concern
why do you need to mofidy the php source files ?.  sorry if I missed that in the explination
i want to prefix the compilation with --prefix
you don't modify the source for that
i want to prefix the compilation with --prefix /some-new-dir
that is a configure option.  eg: ./configure --preifx=/opt/php --sysconfdir=/opt/etc etc etc
don't I need php5 source first?
yes, you do
so which is easier. Prefixes my already working php5 install with some new location or installing zend server in a chrooted environment?
ok - changing your current php 5 install is not going to happen. (easy any way).  putting an addtional php5 enviornment in /opt for example could happen.  running zend in a chroot, I don't see how that would help you ?
Yeah.  plasma is the core of kde desktop :p
Maybe you should install the qt frameqork for it to work with gnome, which is gtk?
package name?
just a second
ok
sorry buffy, I did not found it... may google would helo you more than I have...
I did that
on the other hand i wouldn't recommend you running VNC, the protocl sucks, I would try x2Go instead!
I need to access from a windows pc
no prob with that, x2Go is a multi-platform client and server solution, similar than VNC but better
Can I use it on smarthphones as well? Android, iOS...
what's exactly the error you are getting?
no security types supported. Sever sent security types but we do not support any of their
what about using other VNC client? Still, I highly recommend you X2Go
Ive tried it with uvnc as well
and forget about VNC for ever
its not the viewer that is the problem, it must be some setting in ubuntu. I'm using the pre installed package
I'm not on ubuntu right nowm can't check any of the server settings
why is X2Go better?
if you still want to use a VNC try setting up x11vnc on ubuntu, it's dead easy.  far better protocol, blazing fast compared to VNC, supports strong authentixcation, use of ssh and so on.  check it on their website and ubuntu wiki
im tryin to get to [URL] but it keeps failing why?
try just connection to [URL]. *connecting
I know I can change the wallpaper and the dash color changes which is pretty slick.  main thing I want to do is use a theme other than ambiance or radiance.  I've enabled Adwaita using gnome tweak tool but it doesn't quite work right and I've found a lot of other themes arent quite proper. It seems like a theme has to have very specific properties to be compatible with the Unity desktop
I'm not sure about extra themes I was looking at the web yesterday about this and found links like this with ppa's not sure really. [URL]
interesting.  wonder if those will work in 12.04
you would have to check the ppa's
lunar_lamp whats the diff between doing that and burning the protected file onto a cd, then burning it back onto itunes as a .mp3 ??
- you are allowed a certain number of transfers onto cd etc. you will not be able to burn the file into mp3 legally from the cd. you can transfer it a certain number of times, but it is limited iirc
wtf?? there was no limitation last tiem i checked
hmm, perhaps im totally wrong zeus...
since when are u limited to how many cd's u can burn on itunes
- i was under the impression you were limited how many copies of protected content you could make
yep. i connect with recovery mode to the terminal as root and look in passwd but there seems that dont show the passwords. any idea?
You want to recover the old passwords?
I'm trying to install x86 version of qt5 (from the official website)
ok - why ?.  why not the native version for our architecture ?
regardless, whats the "right" way to disable em?
for an upstart service you could rename its /etc/init/[URL]nf to be [URL]ntrun or edit its contents and tell it to not load
but I still want it to run if I call "service foo start"
for sysv - you nromally remove the LINK in the rc# that you want them disabled..  never really noticed. you may need to edit the .conf file if thats what you want to do
i dont believe so
is X using compositing?
thanks for your help,
if it is, usually its as simple as modprobing the right driver, plugin stuff into usb, and loading up the right application to send/recieve images from it
yeah.. xorg is running, but i don't want to reboot to find that it's actually gone and what i am running is just the hoary version in ram
ah..  in a terminal, dpkg -l *xorg* ii at the beginning means that package is installed
hmm.. rc in front.. guess that means residual config and i should mark it for installation
yes
that's what I thought but can't see it there, must be odl age ... I added ppa:ubuntu-voip/asterisk-1.6-testing
or look in /etc/apt/[URL]st.d
indeed .list.d had it, thanks
no problem
a porno
stop it NOW
is that ftp server or a tftp server  its 2 different protocalls
ftp, sorry
Yeah, but I'm doing it in the GUI
so?
yep
hmm.  Is that for accessing MS Access databases?
what makes bzcat?
Probably bunzip or bzip
Clean install with the help of hachre
Ecryption: did it fail on you with the default drivers on setup?
No it didn't. I just wanted to use the proprietary drivers. After I rebooted, Unity wouldn't show up. After a lot of help it finally did. Now when I reboot, it doesn't reboot like it should.
how about trying the recovery from grub
It doesn't show grub at all.
you can hold shift after bios post boot. to enter grub
Yeah that's the problem, no BIOS post. It just stays on a black screen with underscore when I reboot so I can't do anything.
no bios post doesnt relate to ubuntu, you should at least see post msg boot on your machine right
Nothing like that.
did you recently added new hardware on your machine?
When I click reboot, it doesn't shutdown to reboot. There's just a black screeen with an underscore. It says like that for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.. Nope I haven't.
can you see ubuntu boot or not?
Nope I don't see it boot
try hold shift after you press power on your machine to enter grub, see what happens
I can't shutdown either. If I try to, it's just a blackscreen with an underscore
you can hold your power button until your machine halts right. then reboot
I can turn it off that way yes. But is that good for the system?
if you dont got any other options?
None, should I revert back to the default open source drivers?
i just told you what i suggest
You want me to reboot and hold Shift, what happens after I do that?
reboot and enter grub to try recovery of grpahics
I'm not sure what you mean there I'm sorry. Move keys to open location? My private key?
your prive machine should only stay on the client.  if thats your suggestion I suggest shared home dirs or rsync only
I need my private key to login from a host that is unknown to the server, right?
correct
So without setting up a new private key for that host, how can I safely transport my private key? Say I needed to login from an unfamiliar XP box. Or say, my dad's Linux box
shared home dir's from a central location
Could you give me an example? I'm not sure what you mean
you have all your machines mounting /home or the users home dir's on windows from a shared central samba/nfs server.  so when you login your home dir with your private key is preseted to every host in your home dir
Ah OK, but what if I'm logging in from a different physical location? Another office, etc?
you can still have remote home dir's if you set it up
Over what protocol/software?
over tcp ip networking and samba or nfs as I said
Having remote access to my home dir would pose a new problem.  I'm wondering how I can transport my key on my person. I don't want to open up my home dir (with my private key on it)
use a usb pen.  and you shouldn't open up your home dir
k. this is on free node right?
yes
Yeah, I tried it out...works ok, sound quality is awful in Linux for me for some reason
okay, what about SFLphone?
probably just close and reopen the terminal that you are in I don't think you have to reboot. But you might.
it still says " is not in the sudoers file. this incident will be reported."
wtf is with all the spam today.
how do i open a root terminal window? i bet i should be doing it from there
ahh yeah to add yourself to the sudoers file you would need root. reboot the system and select recovery mode from grubs list..  That should give a root terminal to fix things.
ok, be back in a few... i hope
this: [URL]
Possibly tmux.
it must have been because I tried logging in too many times? I mean I thought it was supposed to return an error if I do that. is that normal for fail2ban? Like to just not even respond with anything?. if I try too many attempts that is. What's the normal behaviour supposed to be?
usually fail2ban will issue a DROP command if you over-try something it is monitoring
which control is that? i can't find it. but the volume is up in the gnome volume manager anyway
right click on your volume control....  click on open volume control....  scroll through the alsa mixer and increase the wave surrond volume control.  that works for me in getting sound out of my 4.1 system
i still can't find that wave setting. i'm using an external soundcard. but i've got an internal too.  if we begin with the tabs. there are two tabs called USB audio class driver (oss mixer) and then two called Intel 82801DB-ICH (alsa mixer)
check the alsa mixer....  what is your sound card by the way?
That is installed, Ive tried reinstalling it, maybe uninstall then reinstall?
no idea what do you want
'cause i got some old songs from my windows partition that i ripped a time ago in wma format.  maybe i didn't write the question right... i got some wma's songs that i want to burn into an audio cd
id consider converting them to wav
and how can i do that? which app should i use?
manually .. lemme check forums [URL]  if youre going to burn an audio cd dont convert em to wma -->wav-->mp3-->wav just wav
how?
Accessories -> Passwords and Encryption Keys
that was fast lol
Then click on the "Passwords" tab, right-click on the Login keyring, and choose Change Password
1.10 i think. 1.10. should i get 1.9?.  so..? its 1.10?
try to install 1.9.6. i think your automake might be broken
should i reinstall?. ok
remove it then install a supported version
I have no idea :(.  probably I didnt
boot windows under virtualbox and click devices -> install guest additions. and it'll install the drivers for your mouse, audio, network, etc
is it in control panel?
in the virtual box application itself, there is a menu bar at the top that says "Machine", "Devices", "help" once you have your guest operating system booted. You just click "Devices -> Install Guest Additions"
I installed it, but It didnt do anything, I think I need to get the audio driver because the card is not detected
virtualbox has an emulated set of hardware (audio, network, etc) so you don't have to get specific drivers for your actual hardware; you just use the guest additions.  you should reboot after you install the guest additions, and see if your audio works then
I can't send mail. I can't be more specific. I'm using mail(); and I don't recieve any mails.
can you send mail using the mail command?. i.e. from the command line?
I don't know. I've tried mail mymail@[URL] and then just write something and ctrl-d. But I don't recieve anything
try replacing the email address with your local username for now and see if that works
And how do I know if it works?
just type mail, and see if it appears
12.10
the latest usually sorts that out. Guess not in your case. Linux been struggling with wifi cards for years
new linux user over here... but i figure there is something i can do to make it more stable
do you have 'pre-released updates' on? make sure you get the latest updates
did that
what error does it give you?
it is a joe editor
esc :wq for vi. as for joe editor. No idea.
^K X
like i need to know how to use joe :)
i didn't look in the forums, this just started annoying me.. its a new laptop.
so new laptop eh? nice
umm mad 64?. amd**. !gpu
I was personally using the proprietary ati driver on my notebook and I couldn't suspend.  I don't know if your issue was similar, but I fixed it by removing the proprietary driver and moving to the opensource drive
umm.. I used the restricted drivers... I guess I can install the binary install from the website..
the restricted drivers have issues with suspend I believe, you should just use the opensource drivers, test them out and see the difference
If I try to compile it with gcc -lm -o test test.c I get the error that lgammaf is not found
read `man gcc` -- where you place -l options matters.  put them at the end of the compilation
great.  seems like the iso img is corrupt or whatever. Can i download 8.04 and burn the img Using Live Cd ?
you could, but you'd need to mount a drive to download the cd to. I'm not familiar with how the live cd works, I never use it
i'm not interested in doing a dist-upgrade.  I just want the security updates for 12.04.  (but that was a good thing of you to mention anyway, because I want to upgrade to 14.04 on another computer :) )
dist-upgrade will update your *current* installation to 12.04.5.  do release-upgrade will bring you from 12.04 >>> 14.04
hm, i'm not sure I follow. but all I'm interested in is upgrading the suggested packages (around 100 or so of them). ah i see. either way, that's not what I want to do in this particular case. ah it appears as though dist-upgrade is actually safer than upgrade. I wasn't aware
err other way ....  dist-upgrade will update ALL packages to latest available and in the repos. upgrade will not but will grab the security updates.
@ It just reboots Windows XP like normal.
You should try UNetbootin to make the USB
'Course.
ahah
to get drbd8 module that's missing in -virtual
what's that module do
makes drbd work =)
care to explain what that is?
what is smarthost?
somethign you don't need ;)
Slackware 13.1
is it 64 bit?
that's not what I'm after. the --html option will make html pages and display them in the browser "firefox"
jowi: oh sorry.
can you try that command in a terminal for me?.  simply run "man --html=firefox man"
doesn't work for me.
groff error? are you using edgy or feisty?
yeah, i'm using feisty.
what do you mean.  i want to copy and paste stuff without using terminal but it keeps saying access denied
Yes. OK. So Press Alt+F2 and type gksudo nautilus. Use with care, you will not be told when you are going to delete something that you aren't supposed to.
when am finished what do i type to end?
Just close the window (as you normally would).
thanks you i hated using terminal to do it
You're welcome. Remember 1. be careful. 2. You will have super-user privileges only on the window that opens with that command and programs you open from that window.
ntfsresize told me in the end that I should do a "chkdsk/f" to fix it, and then it was fine..  well, if it works....  by the way, version 1.4 is available noww - I updated that forums post for the new version.
it should notify me when it realizes that right ?.  with that autoupdate thing that is in Ubuntu
never figured out how to get alsa to play sounds out of the pc in the living room from here. :P
Heh, sheash...  NFS man! NFS! :p.  Actually depends on why exactly you'd want to.
:)
Heh. esound could do that too. heh.  Or simply just remote logging in and playing the sound from within it.
so can you fix that script you wrote out for me?.  this way i can see the difference
the bash man page is a good start, as is 'learning the bash shell', from O'reilly
i'll get it
for file in *.jar; do if [ "${CLASSPATH}" == "" ]; then CLASSPATH=$file ; else CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${file} ; fi ; done ; java -cp ${CLASSPATH} [URL]ass
no
Sooo are you asking a question or just stating a fact?
4.10, tried xmms and cd player.. when i try to open up the cd in nautilus, i receive this error message:. mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdd,. or too many mounted file systems
more than likely it's a volume slider that needs to be unmuted.  you don't "mount" audio CDs
i have no probs with data cd's on the cd dirve.
In the Volume Control, are you using the ALSA mixer or the OSS mixer?
sorry, but how would i find that out.
open up Volume Control
compaq nc6320
What problem are you experiencing?
i did a diff on the /etc/dhcp/[URL]nf must be another config file
that should be it
:exactly ? ok
yes, *exactly*.
Dont know.. dont think so
do you have the source for the software that needs it or is it pre-compiled?
Its on launchpad.. but doesnt seem like there is a PPA. Got the sourvce. But the system hsa a earlier version installed, and removing it will break a LOT of stuff
I would suggest making sure that, when you install it, that it goes to /usr/local or /opt instead of /usr
well it should go into /local by default..
there is no /local
yeah using nano, maybe its nano settings or something
it will be. I expect a [URL]nf somewhere.  [URL]
thanks
np
its just consistent with linux. i'll use my sons computer to try and update the firmware
i have no idea, doesn't make sense.. is it a PS2 mouse, or a USB mouse/
usb
no idea.
its a gaming mouse, not really standard. since it operates at 2000 dpi
thats probably part of the prob... i've got a cheap best buy brand 2 buttons and wheel mouse.. 12 bucks, works fine..  are you sure you edited your menu correctly, so it will work when you reboot?
im gonna reboot now and see
ok, good luck./.
But isn't it mostly a co-incidence that Linux runs on it? Like it was in the beginning.
No idea I just know that this CPU will not run a linux kernel..  or anything other than Windblows
Isnt ubuntu that stable than debian!?
Ubuntu is more eccentric, if you will. More cutting edge
can you tell me about the command?.  , can you tell me about the command?
e.g. [URL]
, do you mean i can chat with other user with the internet connection?
no, talk is for logged in users only. what do you exactly need?
Well, Transmission wont download ether, and after I close it my net still doesn't work. How do I refresh my IP?
@ which type of internet do you have?
DSL 512kbps
interface? eth, nas.. ?
you mean you have the problem too?
yes. allways have to hardreboot my laptop then. I have a toshiba so it isn't just Dell ;)
i bet the evil face of [URL] keeps popping up as well
henk, zeke1 ciao and good luck.
bash: /LimeWireLinux.rpm: No such file or directory
are you sudo? maybe you have to make the rpm executable? e.g. chmod +x filenameandpath?.  not sure :(
same here, i'm reading this off a forum. :s
when all else fails, try making the rpm executable and then use sudo on alien with the rpm... try it out
i need to edit my /var/www folder. the computer isnt connected to WAN. its a private computer in my house lol
still, bad practice. give a normal user access instead.
How did you find that out?.  How did you find that out?
It tells you when you install it. Your package manager of choice should also list it as such.
you mean cowen?. *cowon
yes.. sorry couldn't remember the name.
I'm pretty into it. I certainly like the color scheme better.  Kind of a different paradigm in terms of operating environment
you can also change those with ubuntu-tweak
Yes, but it is unknown. (And more than likely not supported.. )*
Does it get a network interface? what does ifconfig tell you?
But I have the drivers; I don't know where they go though.
What are the drivers?
I have no connection with that PC.. Different .CAB and .bin files
Those are Windows files.
do i need to hit enter before it?. it wont let me type on that line you see
since it's a password, it hides what you are typing
is a sudo password the same as my login paasswor. doh. lol i'm stupid. sorted. thanks very very much
np
saphirre hd 4870 is the card, there is no driver downloaded actually
that is ati? nvidia? you would need to download at some point
I'll look
afaik apt leaves too, but I dont remember the filename
:) Well I can't say either way. I hit the button to, "Update the database" (I assume in reference to the known viruses, etc.) and after that it's been giving me this dialog upon launch of the application.. So I can't say if it was/wasn't succesfful -- only that it 'broke' it.
have you tried reinstalling it? That would definitely fix the issue...it sounds like something got corrupt somewhere. I don't use Avast..  if you can reproduce the problem on a fresh reinstall there maybe something wrong with the package.. I wasn't aware avast supported linux natively...
Shame.. I was hoping to acvoid that. *shrug* Ah well. I'll reinstall. :) (Yeah, there's a Linux version)
not saying it's the only solution but I don't use Avast myself. And it would definitely be easier..  you're more than welcome to ask for other solutions. Just putting my two cents out there so at least somebody answers your question. :p.  why Avast on Linux anyway..? I'm not too worried about linux viruses myself...
Agreed. Reinstall is almost always easier. Just out of curiousity, what is your suggestion of Anti-Virus? (I really use it for Windows -> Linux -> Windows).  Ditto. I use it so I don't contribute to Windows viruses. :)
I usually use [URL] because I typically just want to scan a file\archive every now and then..  but you have to upload the file to that.. Then they scan it with like 42 different AVs. If you only need it infrequently that would be fine.
so I have to set up NIS to restrict the clients?
You can restrict clients by ip address in /etc/exports (or whatever the config file is)..  NIS is used to restrict by user
hm it was expected better than 11.04 :0 that's nice
[URL]
thanks
yeah, I'm inclined to try upgrading one machine past 8.04 now LOL
i get GTK errors when running from the console, and nothing when clicking the launcher
what does it say?
can I paste it in a message to you?
how long is it?
~15 lines
join #flood and send it to me there
but the thing is i dont want to mix up windows and linux on the same partition
Ubuntu setup will create a seperate partition
or it could also be the sound card. it could also be pulseaudio though i doubt it, I suggest you check the forum or launchpad
the sound card works fine in windows
i dont see display in there
2/3 down below "put display to sleep" time
theres no slider
odd, try your Fn keys then
okay, and also without touching any other file :D I want to do that scriptbased, i.e. add or remove a kernel module from loading, for blacklisting it's no problem but I dont want to fuzz around in /etc/modules with a script
without touching a file, how exactly do you intend to apply ANY setting, think about it.....  you can add the line: echo modulename >> /etc/modules in your script (assuming it runs as root)
yes, but how do I remove that line afterwards? that's my concern, adding would not be the problem :). or will blacklisting it override that?. i.e. I can leave it in /etc/modules and blacklist it at will?
could use something like: grep -v modulename /etc/modules > /tmp/modules; mv /tmp/modules /etc
ah, thanks :) didnt think of that
easiest way if you ask me
yes, but didnt think of grep's "Invert match" feature ;)

SINGH: 'sudo dd if=input/file/like/your/harddisk/such/as/dev/sda3 of=/output/file/such/as/a/usbdisk/like/media/usbdisk/image. SINGH: and when you want to restore you just reverse it 'sudo dd if=/your/backup of=/your/harddisk'. SINGH: just remember when doing output file it needs to be a file and not a directory, like /media/usbdisk, do /media/usbdisk/imagefile. SINGH: no, you can backup your current PC or restore a backup you made with it..
i have no backups. and my xorg is messed up
SINGH: it should make a backup if you change it. SINGH: where is the [URL]nf stored again?
etc/x11/
SINGH: cd /etc/X11/ then ls. SINGH: copy it and go to [URL] and send me the link
sure
SINGH: cant you just dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?. SINGH: now that I come to think o fit
i tried that
luvcview
are you using a dodgeytech webcam (or logitech as its more commonly known)
yes
ok run: lsusb one line will identify the cam, you can use the 8 character ID to find guides
oh I know the code its 046d:0804. according to the UVC site its supported
ok then you can find guides based on that code
http://linux-[URL]/ its supported according to this! -_-
maybe you need a later version or some options
ignore my previous statements .. i just forgot how to rread
system > preferences > power
trough console i need to know the name of the device i forgot wireless device
try lspci
prince_ so it's normal and not some hyjack shnit
it's undesirable, but nothing to panic about. someone exec'd it and didn't wait()
I don't like pidgin's smile
you can change them, the emoticons are themable
the site has no search function?
The site I just told you has a search function.
yes
then the '-server' kernel is better suited for it, why do you want to change?
blue goto system>preferences>startup programs and deselect the screensaver app
there is no screensaver app.
really? what version are you on?
10.04 (64 bit)
because i just checked mine and it is right there
10.04 64 bit.
well i am on 9.10 so they must have changed that
i figured rcconf usually controls what starts up - not listed.
blue - well i am lost in 10.04 - 9.10 is the highest i have ever used
lots of things changed in 10.10
no its visible, i was just using it on xubuntu, but i reinstalled everything now it cant find it
open terminal and do "ifconfig" without teh quote [URL] your results.  also whats your manufacturer for your wireless card
its a broadcom 43.xx, the driver works and wireless turns on but shows no network
if you use windows, see if it works on windows, else if you cant see your network, sounds liek your wqifi card might have failed, that happened to me before
i mean its for 14.04....
it's a random user's PPA
i mean i could prol update to 16.04..
perhaps you should if you want those new features. it's not just lvm, you need kernel support, dm-cache, etc... probably an avalanche of updates for 14.04.
may as well i guess
just remember, it's systemd.
yeah nothing that would be affected minus backup software prol. its just a home lab kvm box
unless you handle services and daemons, you probably won't notice the difference :)
yes
i'm curious just how badly you think they suck?. what did you think?
cannon fodder was good :P. anyway enough said
did you think they were simply retro? or did you think any of them actually had a fun component?
I thought they where fun.... I wish I had them now... 1200,600,500. they were good for there time... but out dated now. lol
neat :) was just curious
yeds. yes
Great. Right as I go back to warty, the new menus go in.
yes that is the key i am talking about. The Windows key also known as the Super key..  for some reason it is not working anymore. I used to use it for Expo compiz effect
it should work by default. doesn't it? I has always worked for me.
nano /etc/network/interfaces ,look for line saying iface eth0 and/or 1
nano /etc/network/interface? What?1
sweet. how do i open terminal
gnome or kde?
Okay :) How do I do that?
use synaptic or aptitude from terminal.  "sudo aptitude/synaptic"
Aboed: Is it safe?
what ? running aptitude ? sure
Aboed: In aptitude, what do I do? :). Aboed: I'm rather new at Linux :) I know some things but haven't played around with the kernel..
what u use before?
What do you mean?
*kernel version
no...I went into alt +f2.  I just went into it via sudo...and my second monitor is not even visible?
press: ctrl+alt+backspace, login again and try again..  if that does not work then it can be pretty simple to fix by editing your /etc/X11/[URL]nf
code::blocks doesn't work properly anymore... it won't open.  and neither does ANJUTA - i tried installing ogre from a bash script, i tried compiling from source ... i even used CMake like the ogre readme said
i dunno about code::blocks
i think i might need to TOTALLY remove all the ogre3d stuff
well; maybe those scripts messed something up ?
your opinion sucks then
wow.  no need to be an as
an as
an ass
or just download the kubuntu iso. lol.  I get this E: Couldn't find package kubuntu-settings
just remove it.  only "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"
ok
:)
it works with Linux well?
err, not the "connect 3d" but the sapphire version. and yeah, it works fine
can you do 3D stuff like Quake3 (heh old I know)
exept it wont let me use xv video out with the fglrx drivers. . im betting yes
and does it work "out of the box", or do you have to do some X hacking to get to to work?. [URL] was looking at that
nope. It works right out of the box.  but if you want direct rendering you should check out [URL]
then how do i install linc?
ubuntu uses deb's
i know
what is linc?
x wont start because it says that it cannot open [URL].6. so im trying to find it
you did some manual installing or so?
i did a dist upgrade
sudo apt-get install libxdmcp6.  you may want to check if your dist-upgrade was succesful
when i tried install libxdmcp6 it said it was the newest version
then this file should exist /usr/lib/[URL].6.  are you sure the dist-upgrade was succesful?
It's proprietary, I remember Ubuntu asking me to install the driver, which I did,
Was it fglrx?
How might I check? :S
(Do you have an ati card?) fglrxinfo in a terminal
OpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc. OpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2600 XT OpenGL version string: 2.1.8087 Release
So yea, you do. Does it always happen, or only when the video is full screen?
Always :(
I think you'll either have to force xv output for videos, or just disable compiz while you're watching videos... Though there may be another way... It's been so long since I installed fglrx on my desktop I don't really remember
i thought it checks a directory
it has nothing to do with Thunderbird.
then how does xfce mail checker work?
if you use unix mail with fetchmail, then it should work
well.  you have a mouse? :D. or are you hardcore keyboard guy =)
i must admit here, that i have in fact, from time to time, used a 'mouse'
do "xinput list" ;D
lol, ok.... so what exactly do you mean by 'bind' the shift key to the device?
well.  I have this drawing tablet.  and it has "special keys".  one of those keys I want ot make act like a shift key
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
it's a key, basically, I can press and release it, X11 sees it, too, so basically no problem. I knowhow to do it on the cmdline. I just wondered if there is a GUI program by now that does that
are you using gnome?
yes.  jaunty
sorry... a bit beyond me...
i thought empathy had plugins for that
Iunno, haevn't checked the plugins. Empathy without plugins makes me want to punch puppies.
:D the icon sucks tho :(. in a few weeks it should be added to repos, i hope
icon?
the icon in the gnome menu. its blank for pidgin
u cud probaly change it. haha
the laptop cannot boot to usb
!unetbootin.  you save to hard drive besides usb.  it also installs to the hard drive, i've used it many times, i cant cd burn
is that what i should install "network manager"?
oh you said lubuntu
no ubuntu 10.04
its aruldy installed then
its mysql
either mysql has a setting to make it do the right thing, or I expect it will be difficult to change
ic
there are different frontends to interact with mysql, if it's a big problem
i see most have web gui's, but which one can support downloading via RSS feeds?. i use utorrent for windows, and have done for years!
oh! i meant Transmission :P
rss feeds supported??  ?
idk
wow.. am i REALLY speaking with ?? lol
ye, i know you are glad -.-
the error is rt2860-source: Depends: debhelper (>= 7) but it is not going to be installed. I believe my debhelper is not recent enough?
pastebin your /etc/apt/[URL]st
cant i not create the directory myseld?. myself. it says it has no permission to make the directory. so if i make it manually?. u dont install. its a website. [URL]
in your shell what directory are you in...
i am completley new to linux i have no idea how to find out,
pwd
kk ty.  /home/chris is where i am
I'd start by removing that ruby-rvm package. I don't think it's needed
ok, how do i do that?.
sudo apt-get remove ruby-rvm
tyvm. Removing ruby-rvm ... The group `ruby-rvm' does not exist. Processing triggers for man-db .... . thatss what came up
that's ok, that's another bug I saw mentioned
ok xD now what?. sorrry for being such a god damned noob. my 1st day with linux
what's the output of <unconvertable> whoami <unconvertable> ?
says chris
pastebin <unconvertable> env <unconvertable>
so its not possible to do that
u can.. but don't expect much support yet..
how can i
System>Preferences>Apperance.  that's how i change it..
i meant GDM theme, the login manager...
they removed alot of that from the lucid build
too bad
i know, i loved that customization...  i had found something online about how to modify it, made my OS not want to boot, so i sugguest not doing that
thanks.  i had enough of reinstalling, dont wanna do that again
lucid don't wannna let u customize it like u could before.. but u still have a certain lvl..
whats that
i've made custom graphics for toolbars and window backgrounds.. been workin on new scrips for window borders, but that's more of a hobby for me, nothing offically supported
id love that, is their a way i can have you as a friend on this channel?
mount loop. mkdir /mnt/iso.  i only design for myself...  soz
it wouldn't be able to connect ad hoc if it wasn't on. everything appears to be working fine, except it won't connect to anything
yeah thats odd I would try searching the forums for the card see if anyone is having an issue. But that driver has been around for a long time.
what could hav caused it? no upgrades, no recent changes really that i can think of
one can only speculate..  however, powering off the computer, waiting a few ticks, then powering it on, may resolve it.
sorry, I probably didn't state my case very succinctly. What do you need to know?
I remember from theother day :_>
sorry i mean Apache and i just put being xfce just in case. i installed it from the package manger
good. now sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start.  then point firefox to localhost
ok slo down please. slow
what part should be slower ?
i install Apache not apche2. apache2*
same procedure.  sudo /etc/init.d/apache start instead though
ok siad starting web server ... ok. so its done?
so now go to localhost with your favorite browser
motherboard : PowerBook5,2 MacRISC3 Power Macintosh. detected as : 287 (PowerBook G4 15"). well... the internal broadcom chip is a pain. but the audio?. its like 100% native linux support. yeah. the airport extreme. oh ok. :P
you running ubuntu on that g4pb?
and your audio wont work O_o. yes
heh
and if I recompile, it will automatically take more advantage of the 64 bit, or would I have to set some flags or something or the configure code needs to detect etc...
sometimes programs will detect themselves and adjust (the ./configure stage we're talkking about)
ah, it happens I did a couple of times with my Nexus 7
yeah, nice thing with Linux is that you don't get those drivers issues. you get nvidia driver issues instead :P
Heh, hang here another 5 min you will see them.
yeah, haha, this was the first place I came when I had them. love my nvidia. I was really new to linux back then. dr willis helped me back then.
I have done it under WinXP... but I know how troublesome laptops can be in linux. Anywhere I might be able to find out if it is possible?
what type of video chip does the laptop have?
I'm guessing a bit here, but I think its some SiS model.  its a Dell Inspiron 1000
hrm... possibly search for your model of laptop on the forums but you will most likely hav eto edit your [URL]nf to get it going.
okay, but how should i know which one to use?
it might be safer to use /opt, but /usr/local is in the path to look for commands by default
Okay I feel kind of silly now but, in which directory do I execute this command?
the one that autogen.sh is in
Okay, so I tried to run that command, and i said I needed gnome-common. so i downloaded and installed that from synaptic and tried again. this time i received some errors.
could you please pastebin those errors?
ok. btw can i run wine to run starcraft ? i ran it fine on xp. with 196 ram
i think it works but check [URL] to make sure
type that in the console right?
yes
no such file or directory
oh, are you on Warty?
that's the tricky bit, I don't have a large enough USB :|. so I'm trying to do it live while booted into the existing system
you don't have a 2 gb USB? they are cheap. buy one.  you can image from current HDD to new HDD with DD command
what command
the one it gave you .. 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
yes iItried but did't work
R U sure U added 'sudo' at the start ? ' sudo dpkg --configure -a '
yes I did
what did you try to install to get this message?
Thanks Mahmoud 85 forgot the sudo Now it works
:)
:D ty i must have miss typed it when i put it in paste bin was copying from my notepad lol.  does it look right tho?
What is this supposed to be doing? iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i ! eth1 -j ACCEPT
if its a new connection thats not from the interface eth1 to accept
Just making sure. I assume this is in case you have more than 2 nics. It doesn't look wrong to me... but it is not my area.
because in my example eth1 is the internet while eth0 is the lan
^
yes there is two nic's because you have to be able to have one connected to the modem while one is connected to a switch
Just making sure. I assume this is in case you have more than 2 nics.. eg 3+
nope just 2 its for a small office
otherwise you should just specify eth0. because if there are three nics it will try and forward it. whatever "it" is
ok. :D i found a iptables irc ty for your help tho. did you forget your password?
I would let it detect and assign. For instance if a nic died, and another was installed, or for whatever reason udev is written oddly due to screwing around... it will not work..  s/let it/write it to/
there could be  i was setting up nginx and pressed ctrl + z when it was doing sometim
can you visually see any package manager windows ?
ah ok, that sux a little, any idea when it will become more flexable?
no idea. i really dont worry about it
i dl it. and know?
exec it
atlet, yes thanks, who want to learn Spanish?
this is probably not the right channel
atlet: maybe :-( but I don't find any room to it...can you help me?
!offtopic | .  may have better luck there
where?
!offtopic >
ok, thanks, I'm going to try it
good luck
thanks...by the way....I'm using Ubuntu 8. It's good. any problem
i would agree
it's for my car's audio player. The seek function is horrible (VERY slow.)
um, try wavbreaker (disclaimer: I've never used this myself)
so what I do is split automatically at every 60 seconds. If I want to continue where I left off (podcast episode, for example), I can just quickly skip to the track # I left off on..  is it a plugin for k3b or another application entirely?
sorry, it's a separate app. You did ask for a k3b feature....
I can use mp3splt-gtk to split the mp3 podcasts, but I was hoping K3B had a similar feature that Brasero has: auto-split tracks..  Brasero is acting really goofy for me. It doesn't seem to unmount discs when erasing them or when burning, and this has ruined some of my CDs.
brasero is incredibly buggy. Not sure why....
also, Brasero puts the FIRST 60 seconds as the LAST track, but the rest are in proper order. This seems like a bug that was overlooked.
well, I don't see any google hits for k3b and autosplit....
no problem, thanks for trying though.
actually, this site says it can split files, so poke around: [URL]
noooooooooo
k. what was the proxy type?
no proxy
the last option in advanced tab
gnome proxy
use global proxy settings
there is no such option
k..
now my brouser not work
if the browser is not working then may be your net is down
but before changing d setting it works properly. .  r u there
changing the settings of pidgin will noteffect your net conn.  dont worry.  you in some iit?
pelo tbh io havnt tried, i thought it was something i did wrong during install. I will have a go now
there is very little you can do wrong during the install
I was trying to copy things using basicley. its in digital ocean. I had 2TB of images there . (total 4tb) images were important. i checked fsck -N /dev/sda1
I don't know what basicley is and I'm not using digital ocean. What did fsck reply?
it says fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1. i wanted to pkill basicley it didnt work . so I restarted it. after restart everything is gone
try fsck -f /dev/sda1. !info basicley. This isn't an Ubuntu package, so it's not supported here. I don't know if anyone knows about it. Does fsck report any errors?. (fsck -f)
basicley is not the problem here.. btw fsck -f is checking inodes block and sizes
If something affects initramfs, it may be a problem. If not, possibly not.. ...or the disk in general
recovering the images are my priority.  is fsck -f supposed to take a while ?
So did fsck find any errors?. Yes, it takes a while if there are many files etc
thanks.  libsqlite3-tcl is already the newest version.. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 93 not upgraded.. I can't find that
then the library is at /usr/lib/tcltk/sqlite3/[URL]
Hi. My Jaunty install just completely crapped out on me. I can't even boot into recovery mode - I'm in a Live CD now, can anyone help me check my disk for errors or direct me to error logs where I could troubleshoot this futher?
Anyone here that could help me with Samba? I have problems sharing folders without getting the login prompt?. Anyone here that could help me with Samba? I have problems sharing folders without getting the login prompt? But i dont have any problems with login prompts when i enter the computer at Network in Windows?
i didn't quite wait... but more than 30 secs... and i saw another thing.... i've hit the power button, and i saw that the last process stopped was alsa... coincidence?
Strange :S. And this happens everytime/
alsa doesn't work btw... the test makes a bad sound... do i need to install more packages?
K.  damn ALSO is so problematic it would be a nightmare helping you over IRC :P
alternative? pulse audio?
sorry I wouldn't know. Also seems to be the main one
got any idea how to fix it?
jeff, i dunno from this thing here :(
more of kubuntu area
if we dont know the problem, we cant even start to fix it ;-)
Is there a way to check which one I have installed?
which is installed, or which you are using?
I don't know which one automatix2 installed for me.
use Synaptic to check
it's the first time I've used it. I usually use apt-get
and for the love of pete, never ever use automatix or easyubuntu or anything else ever again? :)
@carflex i didnt get how ioot from a live cd
adding the @ to my nick makes it not my nick, so I may not see it.
any irc chat rooom lol
No. Not "any" irc chat room. Some have web apps built for them on different sites but it is not a requirement.
what about the freenode server its self?
Not sure. Probably somewhere. What exactly are you trying to do?
I cant recover my backup, the app cant pull files from the copy
I see. I like dejadup for that. It does not see the backup? Try opening the file manually (or uncompress even) and look inside.
I've done the recovery manuly, but I'm pissed couse it took me two ours..  can deja do backups on hour base?
Yes. [URL]  Just make sure to point what you want to backup. There are some people that just assume that dejadup knew people wanted to backup home directories when it's just pointing at nothing. :)
naw the rpm installed it right. i checked
You did WHAT???
lol.. i used the rpm
How?
yea ... how to fix ?.  how to fix ?
I sent you a URL...
bookmarked ....  i'll run the config again
you'll need to explicitly list your HorizSync and VertRefresh
brb
hold on
but when it connects...it's says modem hangup.  lucid lynx 10.04. any tips?
try this $ sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/15-huawei-[URL]les
iv locked all I needed with sabayon, but i got an annoying user that changes the theme to big letters with high contrast....  do you know specifically whete in sabayon i can disable that?
nope
is a gem to atach files to a moel.  model
Perhaps a ruby channel would be more appropriate for your question, #ruby perhaps (it might be #rubylang)
No luck
can you pastebin your /etc/apt/[URL]st for me?
[URL]
uncomment (remove the #) from all the lines taht start with deb or deb-src.  then do sudo apt-get update and then you can isntall it
is it reliable?
Yes
beldar sent you couple pm's
I don;t do pm's it's off.
yepp. no idea how to use it. but its there
monotoko -- iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -j DROP. wait..
...awesome thank you :D. ohh. ?
monotoko -- iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp --sport 80 -j DROP ^there
...hehe thanks :D
monotoko with the -I you have to specify where to insert... the 1 after OUTPUT makes it the first rule =)
because it's a hybrid server/emergency desktop!!
pfft who needs a GUI on their desktop
it was a few days ago i didnt change anything else it rebooted and gave me the prompt
freefrags: no error code?
Heh its never straight forward with newer hardware. I'm rockin two AMD Sapphire HD6850's and I want to get my dual monitors working again or at least the darn catalyst driver.
you're right; that's far from straightforward lol.  afraid i've never attempted what you are in linux, sorry but i don't think i'd be helpful
no clear solution on that
did you try either of them? Have you tried anything else?
if i'm not sure of the solution I don't try it, especially if I don't understand and people there saying it doesn't work for them
so what have you tried and what else have you found from your research on this?
iiiears: hi ears
f4phantom - enable them in synaptic - much easier than d/l ing each one at a time.
I would like to change the CAPS-LOCK key into CTRL for my own convenience
maybe keymaps is the answer. i'm reading the man pages now
as far as I know? I created the folder. with mkdir. and I downloaded things to it. I seem to have access in terminal, but not in gui?
thats irrelevant, if the partition is mounted read only, not even root can write to it (afaik)
um.. really?.  I have an Ensoniq AudioPCI in here. How would I do this?
make sure that the card can support full duplex or something
how do I check that?
are you using the alsa drivers?.  has double sounds worked before?
I'm using alsa, and I belive I've had more than one app using sound at once before, but I think it was via esd, I dunno. It worked in Windows.
well you can't actually compare this to windows
I just want it to work :). so what do I need to do?
well I am not sure that the card supports it with the drivers
ergh... then what can I do? It's insane to not be able to pause and unpause a video in totem because when you hit play again, esd has taken over the soundcard
turn of esd?. turn off even.  with a card that can't handle full duplex or the driver is not supporting it...then it is very useless to have the sound demon on.  is it a card that is built in to the motherboard?
<seaphor> ok
ok,, go here- and scroll down to the fourth step http://www.wood-bee-[URL]
skype but better. you can recieve sms for free
IC! Cool.
that isn't there. I've installed ccsm from the command line.
installing it from package should add that menu.  regardless of command line or pkg mgr
eh? what would it likely be called?
As I said. If you have router, then there is an option in your router setting with wich you can auto updated to dyndns. Do you have router?
yes, what would the setting be?
Hold on ofr one sec.. for*.  Log in to your router as admin then go to TOOLS and then DYNAMIC DNS... enter your settings for your DynDns account and save settings on your router..  You have to klick on "enable" in "dynamic settings".
i don't have anything like that, what type of router do you have?
DLink.
yeah i've got a belkin
Try to search the web then. Sorry.
yes...I've got everything turned up in alsamixer etc...I asked a couple times because no one responded. which is fine, people are busy, im patient
what happened in the troubleshooting link from !sound
!sound.  nothing happened...ALSA is selected but sound only comes from one speaker
Silly quesion.. do you dual boot ... do both speakers boot there... is the plug all the way into the back or is this a lappy
intel,
hold the letter c while booting with a bootable cd in the drive to boot to the cd
I know, I was looking for thoughts about it, rather than an installation process.
i think thats how.  my thoughts: overpriced
=> thanks this is comforting :). I did ctrl+d to skip it and my /home/users were all gone, so I reboot and let it do it
altough.. I've had drives do that that ended up having issues..
I don't think this library has any ABI versioning per se -- I know it breaks compatibility on pretty much every minor version
is it frequently updated?
not lately
based on Debian Library Packaging Guidelines, the n has to be the SONAME (use objdump -p filename | grep SONAME to see this).  you might be able to have a package name of libname-version-soname.  actually, scratch what I said; see [URL]
startx works, and it opens a terminal from which I can launch fluxbox
so your problem is getting xdm to work?
yep pretty much
If you try "sudo xdm" from terminal, is there any error message?
Nothing, the screen flickers and return.
No errors... Is there some sort of /var/log/xdm.log file?
there's X.org.0.log.  the X.org log doesn't contain any obviouis errors though.
Strange. I'm not sure what the matter is then.
Ok thanks anyway. By the way, since I never did get xdm to run, what's it suppose to show me anyway, a login-screen similar to gdm, or just a simple interface with a terminal like startx ?
It's like gdm but a lot simpler. You simply type in your username and password and it opens your default window manager.
btw my mic works fine in my windows partition.  dude come on dont be ignorant if i need to yell to someone in my house then i need to if it's any of your business
its a joke :p
hmm. I hope so. I would hate if I had to change to unity to have better fullscreen performance. :P
Ubuntu mate comes with compiz and Compton preinstalled, at least last time I tried
and ubuntu lts also use these guys?
use these guys?
compiz and compton :D
I was thinking the same :-P
it's there, but greyed out
maybe ntfs-utils are missing?
ill check
sry called ntfsprogs.  not utils
correct, it's not installed.  yup, it's back
n1 :)
i suppose he killed the wrong "process"
using the guided install will get you learning easily and quickly. i suppose it'd be hard to fight bad guys while getting the pid correct
i want to compile c
!build
for that i just have to use export $HTTP_PROXY ..... right?. the thing is, i just installed the same ubuntu i have in my laptop. and i set this up in the System->Pref.... shouldn't that be enough?
w/o the $, yes
Yep, I have. (I love your nick, btw)
thanks (its a harry hill joke ;)).  what version of windows are you connecting to?
Windows 7
[URL]  read that, it has pointer, you can then use the usual network icon in nautilus. Windows 7 is annoying and has a 'revised' samba with new authentication nonesense in it as well as some other apps causing grief
I'm trying to use the linux drivers, not the windows one.. just running 'nvidia-xconfig' does not seem to work
it connects to the same internet right?
It says "No such file or directory"
are you sure? cd ~/.local/share/ ; ls # do you see the trash?.  this is for hardy, if you have an older release it's different
for netbeans
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk
thanks! i wish i could just type that into the run dialog :-x
in the run dialog do "nautilus applications:///"
woohoo! thanks!!!
it's too bad that right-clicking on the menubar applet doesn't bring up a link to applications:/// -- would be handy
ain't been reading much tbh :P
that's dangerous.
@ yep, everything updated. how can i send private messages here Oo
2x click on a name
ok thx
don't you have any options there ? something ..a box to check ?
david, what's landscape?. nvm, installing package now
[URL]  [URL]  "You can manage machines remotely from anywhere you can access a web browser. "
i dont need to run as root. i actually need to subtitute user.  i was using root as an example, i cannot su to any user. authentication failure
you are using the password of the User you are suing TO?
How do I check ?
"ls -l".  ls -l /etc/sudoers
dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d. It is not the sudoers file that is the problem, it's the sudoers.d folder that is..  I get dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d
you don't have /etc/sudoers?
I do have /etc/sudoers ; but that file is not the problem..  For sudoers, I get -r--r----- 1 root root 609 2011-06-10 02:08 sudoers.  But for sudoers.d ; I get dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d
yes, i saw.
how could I check?
just keep an eye on resource usage with any of the miriad of tols out there
nope. I don't want unity so I logged in using gnome 3
What "application launcher" are you talking about then?
But in gnome on 11.04 you could right click an app and click "Add to launcher".  http://3.[URL] See those icons and also the context menu on right click
Was this classic or Unity in 11.04?
... yes
so gdesklets or screenlets. or everything doesn't work? :f
oh sorry... i tried gdesklets. didnt work. do i just type in "screenlets"?
now screenlets are cool. imo yes
is it similar in function?
full on. n its in ubuntu repos
yeah. everything installed. i think i have to bring it up at first before coming into gnome right
iok in the gdm login screen (where you type you username/password0 under session select kde
it doesn't show any session. it only user name and then password. no session comes up. i had suse linux before
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
that had it
sorry kubuntu-desktop
Visual Effects is set to none right now, which I believe is compiz=off?
- did you set it to none?
It was set to none. I just tried to turn them on, but it said desktop effects could not be loaded, maybe I never installed compiz?
- make sure you have hardware drivers installed.. once thats installed.. reboot and install compiz settings from synaptic
ok will try, thanks.
ok  good luck
:) thank you for your advise. what port number should i use?
whichever you like :) 222 is easy to remember
is it hard to find with namap?. nmap*?. port scanning ?
it'd be found if someone actualy scanned you and connected to all open ports to see what's running.  but since I changed port I havn't gotten any weird connections
it removed the temp files when I cancelled.  for copying and pasting?
it's kind of awork around but it works if you don't have your mouse enabled in the terminal
I do have my mouse enabled
try middle click then
it was one of the regular users (not root)
make your changes in /etc/X11/[URL]nf
how do i do that?
you edit /etc/X11/[URL]nf
is that safe?. how would i do that?. im using gnome
what are you trying to do anyway?
sure thing.  Do I need to log out first?
you could, but I never have anything running that matters at that point :)
pelo Songjuicer can do it
just stick the cd in open soundjuicer disk > extract I would guess
i need to build kernel from source, that's all i know, debian is not preferred [URL]
Ubuntu's source and binary pacakge formats are the debian source and binary package formats. Those instructions say to use fakeroot and they are correct.
then source=debian?.  ^
I don't understand your question.
it dosent boot i get error message no mmconfig hlst0
okay how did all this start now?
just normal start up. i got some updates yesterday that i installed when i started my computer this morning my xserver was broken. i reinstalled xserver ran the xconfig. got my graphics back
and now if you press ctrl+alt+F1 it doesn't go to a terminal?
it dose nothing
i'm sure someone will come in and be able to answer your question its still pretty early I don't know enough about what controls the terminals.
i dont know... inst a cd that install it on linux. i cant remember where i found it
for the Quake 3 thing to work you need the windows game. for the Quake 3 data
no
you have to copy the data files off the game disk into your linux insta;;
ins installs ok
*install
<>.  their rules? you mean it depends on whether it is ok to help with it?
i'm not local, so just shared on what i'd check at first
very funny i have and i'm just waiting for a reply to my earlier message regarding bitdefender which everyone seems to be ignoring!
no one is ignoring you. We just don't know the answer. Try again later when different people are on.
i don't have the paramter anymore. i had it in the beta version but now with a fresh install i don't even have the on-battery tab on power settings
is your laptop charging? go to System / Preferences / Power Management - Uncheck Dim display when Idle
thanks i think i found it with nm-tool.  it says ath9k does that mean it's using backports driver?
not sure what you mean ... this is the atheros driver
ok thanks
np
14.10
is it up to date?
yes
genuine ubuntu, not some derivative?
nope, xubuntu. but i deleted most of xubuntu-desktop stuff and installed cinnamon, but problem emerged after i tried to add a repo manually through 'software and sources'
sounds like you're missing an update as a result of removing too much stuff. (in my opinion)
nope
nope?
usb. it sees my wifi network. but will nto connect
yeah, i think its a ralink chipset, hang on
I did have MAC control and WPA but I turned those off. how do i check. its the one that virgin media dish out
do you ahve anything under system/admin/hardware drivers
does dlink have their own irc channel?
even if they did, its unlikely they support linux
let me check
:)
I dont see hardware drivers. I'm using server edition with gnome desktop installed
system/admin/additional drivers maybe?... the name has changed for that tool several tiems
yeah. what is it
!ubotu tell  about xgl
yes i can but dont really want to at the mo..... cant be arsed faffing setting things the way i want them aint got time at the mo.  just need nautilus to work prperly that sets the destiop background etc and icons does it?
am not sure its only nautilus doing that, i think its the windows manager you select
what is the ubuntu-motu channel for?
it's the Masters of the Universe; the guys that handle the packages in universe hang out there. It used to be very informal but I don't know about recently. But for sure they use ppa's
Nope.  I have an HP laptop, you must be thinking of someone else
probably. some guy helped me out a lot with hibernation
Oh, that was me then. My hack happened to work on your machine too
the thing with telling the ACPI that it aint linux?
Yeah. Although it does that by default now in the kernel hardy has.  They claim to be Windows, iirc. They are aiming for bug for bug compatibility with that code path since it is the only one the BIOS writers test
soo frustrating not getting hibernation running
that doesn't exist in synaptic
something similar?
I've looking but I can't find it. been*
try libjack-dev
that doesnt work. I put insmod, then mount in the same file (/etc/rc.local) but the mount doesnt wait for the driver to be loaded and fails
perhaps the module is inserted but then the driver needs a little while before it can handle requests
my guess is insmod exits, but the driver still has to load itself fully
what kind of driver is it?
I know. X is still running,but KDE is dead.. i have to kill X with ctrl-alt-bksp
you mean gdm is starting back up its supposed to
after i kill the X server, yes.. but i keep hitting control-backspace
oh its not killing gdm
leaving me with a useless session until i restart X. no. gdm returns to the login sreen. screen
its supposed to.  what you whant it to do crash to text?
network-manager app/. ?.  network-manager-kde?
i dont knwo the specific package names that looks about right.
i want to get a newer version but i can only access 1.06 throught synaptic
you will either need to compile from source, or maybe find a newer deb on like [URL]
what is a deb?
if you ever used windows, you used installers to install a program. A deb is a file that installs the files for an application in the right place
oh k.  so i look for a transmission deb on [URL]?
yeah
Ubuntu 13.04 will be supported for 9 months....
so?
Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS is a long-term support release..... nothing bad, just i want to know which one will be stable
and you can upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10 to 14.04 and so forth.  you want stable, even if it dosent support your newer hardware? or you want better support for latest gixzos?
well, i have used 12.04 without issue in my other desktop. but the only distro that was working in my laptop was mintlinux. i think that is an ubuntu based distro
mint should be using the same kernel and core as ubuntu
yes
do you have a line for it in your /etc/fstab file?.  if so, what is it?
I made a distro update recently, and since I can't compile any kernel, with the same config as I always used
error?
well it compiles fine, but i get the error msg "Unable to mount root filesystem on unknown partition".  I know the current Ubuntu generic kernel uses sda as drive, but my custom kernels use hda... i tries both
tried passing it a root= ?
root=/dev/hda3.  also tried root=/dev/sda3
hrm, no idea... I would double check HDD support and FS support in your config.  maybe with make oldconfig
Does that apply to the Launcher icon?
can go in a terminal and, sudo updatedb, then, locate [URL]sktop if you (probably [URL]sktop).  yeah launchers typically come from .desktop entries as far as I know.  program called alacarte is helpful for modifying menu entries too most of the time... not using Unity here anymore so can't check
Okay cool, and on an unrelated note, how can I check to see what privileges I am letting wireshark run with?
typically if you start a process it has your user privileges you can check top to see what users process are run as or use, ps aux, that'll list the processes along with the user info
yeah it went slick.  have you been able to write to the usb stick as ubuntu user?
i couldn't access the usb drive in itself, didn't investigate much though
it gets mounted as /cdrom. on my box
ah ok. i just needed something that installs ubuntu without a cd :) it worked :) :)
I have tried chmod but it hasn't worked. root has read/write and everyone elsee has read only
ic, try -o remount,uid=1000,gid=1000
I cant..../var/lib is missing
I would recommend a reinstall..
I have a Dell Laptop. the mic comes integrated with the laptop
I'll take it that means you don't know what soundcard then. What says result of command from in Terminal: lspci|grep Audio
then what should I do? stare at my computer?.  I am doing my best to get some help
you should forego posting bogus links repeatedly and try not to use the F word as well.
did you install it from the repo's?
yes
mine fails, it runs for like 2 seconds and tells me it can't add a file... i was trying to compile a nightly (or something newer) and i can't resolve the dependencies...
hrmm..well the repo version runs just fine, try that one and then edit the /etc/mt-[URL]nf file
i did, it runs for 2 secs and if i check my syslog it says it can't add 1 file. it seemingly "crashes" after that, as it's no longer running..  maybe i should run it without any music first?
that's the purpose of running the repo version, as dependencies are met
yes, that's why i tried the repo version first. i only tried to compile after it failed to run.
you try going to the admin gui via your browser? http://localhost:3689 ?
it's not there as mt-daap stops on that error.
did you edit the mt-[URL]nf file?
yessir. i think i should try running it w/o a music directory...
what directory are you using?
!pastebin | bluefade.  no you got kicked for flooding
damn. does that mean i cant chat anymore ?
no, just paste using the pastebin
oh ok...wait. what next....how will u see that ?. should i give you some link ?
paste to the paste bin and tell us the URL
[URL]
ok, lemme take a look
thanks man, i'll wait
it doesn't say why it just says FAIL LOGIN. I checked the logs before I asked the question
Did you restart the ftpd ?
- thanks. makes me feel much better :D
:D
oh :)
echo "$foo" | sudo adduser.  but keep in mind you'll want to pass flags to adduser, not just use it by itself.  the man page will help you with that.  else it will hang asking you for last name, first name, ...
@ and that will work for multiple questions, as it asks, for name, password (twice) etc
the man page explains all
. it's sensing the card. I can even mount it. manually. it used to mount the card automatically
do you have the dev in /etc/fstab ?
yup. I do. should I not have it there?
you should comment it out.  if you are running gnome, run gnome-volume-properties to double check your settings after that
error: device /dev/hda1 is not removable. error: could not execute pmount.  ping?
I suppose you are making some simple mistake, if not, you may have to configure ivman yourself
ah its the notification area. thanks
:)
no, PCI.
just using it in Ekiga ?
I just tried using it with sound recorder. it recorded nothing..  the microphone is turned all the way up and capture is permanetly turned on (I can't unset it)
you want to point your specific application to the location of the device
they're pointed to ALSA. There is no other ALSA device on the system.
does the mic/card work, have they been tested (hardware) ?
The microphone WORKS FOR MONITOR. That is, when I unmute it, I can hear myself immediatly through the speakers..  thus, the hardware must be functioning.
sure, thats a good assumption to make.  not sure I can offer any more suggestions, sorry
[URL]o
the iso's are bootable
can i transfer my vuze partial download to transmissioon?
hold on lemme check something really quick.  no transmition will not recodnise a partial from vuze
which client would do?
hmm what is the extention on the vuze partial?
i have bitttorrent, bittornado, deluge installed.  also have ktorrent
ahh i c  may i enquire as to what the change in torrent programs is for so i can help better?
I must open alsamixer to unmute headphones and raise the volume to get sound from the speakers, everytime I reboot. which is a bit annoying. doesn't work in gui xfce
don't know how to fix .. is possible to change to pulseaudio?
I've tried it, but I can only scale it to 600x450
use the crop-tool to cut things out or adjust the canvas-size. In order to change width and height indepenantly, you need to remove the "lock" located to the side of the textboxes where you enter the new resolution
?
What's the name of your file manager?
I am using the default file manager of Ubuntu 13.10. I dont know the name, Is it nautilus? idk. Also I can't right click :P.  how to reinstall the default file manager?
sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus
thx i am doing it now. hmm still the same situation. I will reboot
wait
yes
type uname -r
error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_SDL
is libsdl installed?.  er, libsdl-dev
the optimum is 1280x1024. @60 hz
I see. What's the question?
yeah this is ubuntu server so i'll have to use du or something
[URL] good start up article
thanks
yw
du just hangs sometimes. i also have 0 bytes free so that could be a problem
yea possible 0 space causes odd issues with applications
time to go deleting
is this a remote server?
home media server
boot the live cd and run the du's find's from there if needed
i found a few to delete. 30gb may be too small for a boot drive and temp download folder eh?
30gb for boot is huge unless you plan on having a *lot* of kernels. unless you mean boot=root..
can't find it there :(. I have wireless if it makes a difference. or actually. it is there :D. thank you
yes
ok thnx
!empathy. !info empathy. !im. hmm.. some of the factoids need updating
i think it's a kernel issue.  so really don't know where to report a bug
haha i was just thinking that.
might want to update the bot then
not right now :). it's broken
general. for termimal. file folder. etc
are you referring to bash commands in the terminal?
exactly. i just switched to ubuntu studio from lubuntu
those are not ubuntu studio related
so how to go
you need to some reading up on that, theres no way possible to list every bash command here on irc
give me link
link to what
from where to read. the commands

its too much . i mean i have to read a lot
there are other places on the internet for that, its not an ubuntu specific issue so search for it
does it work just as if it were installed to a hard disk ?
pretty much
: that's about the only place I seem to be able to fix it.
I hear in breezy they're going to make a much better network manager
:-o ok. let me try. but it wont break down any kernel thingy or dpkg thingy right?
its just gets the packages straightened out, helps things a fair bit
ok.  i copy pasted all those command in one .sh file and then run it with sudo but nothing happends. terminsal sits there
works here (the file extension is meaningless in linux ;))
k
also consider installing the full graphical environment: 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
what would i change in the settings to make it not segfault?
you could try moving or deleting the settings and see if starting clean helps
how do i add accounts?
preferences - add
np
do dpkg '*apache*' | grep ^ii , that will show all the installed apache packages. You will need to remove apache2.2-common and the mpm version you are using to get rid of the rest of apache. apache2 package is a metapackage, it's like a list of packages to install
sorry mate, but i got this: dpkg: need an action option
heh dpkg -l '*apache*' | grep ^ii
im not familiar with that command, soz lol. ah yup that worked.  cool, so i just remove those packages that show up?
yes..  dpkg -l lists all packages that match *apache* , and the grep ^ii finds all that are installed (that's what the ii means)
and it only has the wired connection.  ahh let me check thx, one sec.  nope, still just lo and eth0. they both just say "no wireless extensions"
is the device a usb device?
nope, just the build in Broadcom Wifi card on my laptop.  I just installed 12.04 after a full wipe/reformat.  I was just on 11.10. it was working fine on 11.10
I think it just needs the firmware package
I would basically assume that it's close to working, maybe I just need to ifup?.  ok, what firmware package is that? do you know the name?
might if we knew what device it was
BCM4311
b43-fwcutter
ok i'll try that
sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter;
ok, so now that I have that package, what do I do?.  I'm wary of running anything other than the jockey install process.  last time I tried to do this without jockey I really royally screwed up my install
then maybe should reboot after the jockey in hopes that fixed it
yeah ok I guess I'll reboot once more, we'll see
also see [URL]
any reason why?
because the vista boot loader does not play nice. lol
Like switching to gnome?
all DE's have eyecandy. turn that down/off for energy savings. not sure if gnome is any less demanding
yes :P
luckily for you, I found a solution not more than two minutes ago
is it the 3d plugin?
go to the Beryl settings manager. in the "General Options" set "Level of Fucus stealing prevention" to "None"
just to chek if XAMPP works. with that redirect too
there are free proxies on the internet for such tests.  for instance [URL]/
how about recovery mode without restarting?
I don't believe that is possible, but I could be wrong
well I have the ppa that I needed to get deluge
well, that explains it, then :)
ok but I still cant find where its actually coming from
m4j: well, that looks like a source package, so unzip it, and look an the installation instructions that live inside (probably a 'readme' or 'install' text file). and of course, read the general instructions on installing from source on the wiki.. !software. !software | m4j
can you define better "point what you want when adding to it" ?
Sure if you have a save of a picture for example make sure it is going to the folder in dropbox.
well that would be great but I was looking for better integration. like if I opened /home/pictures it shows my files from dropbox's dropbox/photos
I'm not sure you can do else really, dropbox is a 3rd party so integration would be in the configs or a syslink maybe.
^ is what i want. i see
Those extra clicks wearing you fingers out. ;). your*.  I meant symlink, my mistake. ;) Just a guess though.
06:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32). Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0cf3:e301 Atheros Communications, Inc.. Those are the outputs
some equal devices need the atheros 10k firmware, [URL] and this > [URL]
So Ubuntu is still shipping it in 13.04? Awesome, thanks :) Upgrading tomorrow ^^
note: when I try to open a folder from the Fallback menu, it opens Totem mediapayer, so not Nautilus filemanager
What? O.o But I guess I can fix that somewhere... *sigh*
and when returning to Unity after Fallback, my launchbar is set back to default
ok .. but I can't get in my system right now .. Is there a way to get in?
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/dir.  mount it with knoppix or live CD////
i mean software that record and spiltt files on auto
it has a lot of features, I think that one is in it as well
tried both file types. and changing back to the exact same default login sound config still doesn't work
ok check under system/preferences/ sound to be sure nothing is musted and also with alsamixer in the terminal.  they sould be .ogg files I believe.  i am also assuming you renamed the new file to the same name as the old one ...yes??
system/preferences/sound is fine and all other sounds play fine- just the login won't work anymore. tried renaming the file to the original- desktop-login.ogg and still doesn't work. odd thing is that reverting back to the original desktop-login.ogg file doesn't work anymore either
was this the drums one or the song one.  did you restart x to test or even reboot
song one. restarted x and rebooted several times- no luck
so it was the deskto-login.ogg ..yes?.  rather desktop-login.ogg
yes, desktop-login.ogg
let me find another sound here and test hold on
tried changing the setting in system/preferences/startup applications/Gnome login sound and no luck. Tried changing manually as root in /usr/share/sound/ubuntustudio/stereo and no luck either
mmm ok its going to take me a while to test ... I have to increase volumes on these sound files I have
hold ona sec
and keys sticcccccccccccck
i'm using the alternate install because it's an older machine and can't handle the live install
are you sure it's freezing? Locale generation does tend to take a while on older computers.
- I was at about 6 hours
sebsebseb: it's freezing during the installation itself?. sebsebseb: sorry, mistab.  It's freezing during the installation itself, or during updates or something later?
- it's hanging at 1% at the "Configuring language-pack-en-base" stage. was at that point for 6 hours straight when I gave up
weird. Is it reproducible, or did it only happen the one time?
- i found a post about it, it seems to have problems when it gets to en_us.utf-8 (if i hit alt f4 to see what is going on).  - seems from what others have said it happens every time
how much memory does it have?
- over 200 megs i believe (it's been stored away a while so i forget the exact amount).  - this seems to be close to what's happening to me, although i'm trying to install not upgrade [URL]
Could possibly be [URL] . Comment #13 has a workaround, but it's a little complicated.
I just want to be able to read the filesystem from Linux as a regular user
put it in /etc/fstab. with 'user' in the list of options
Will I have to reboot for that to take effect?
no just 'umount /media/hda....  then 'mount /media/hda...
launch apps
the terminal can even do that
i'm running 8.04 on an HP dv9819wm and I'm having trouble getting the wireless card recognized
is there any reason not install 8.10? the wireless drivers are MUCH MUCH better in 8.10
JAUNTY
ouch.. a bug from hoary coming to life like in a bad horror movie
I coul always try a different WM besides Gnome, if I know for sure it will work :D
I would suggest opening that bug again.. attach a screenshot of your own and information on ubuntu version, flavour and so on
that bug dates to 2005 holy
I can't verify the bug since I just have one monitor attached..
im not sure atm but i think its Ralink
So its not an Intel wifi card at all..  Nonetheless, we need to know the exact make and model.
what decoder does mplayer use then?. ffmpeg?
I thinks so, which one seems most comfortable for you (since you can use any of them)?
well im trying to achieve a 1 decoder set to rule my desktop. i can use just about anything just trying to save space were possible less dependencies etc you know
You could check dependencies to see what libs are in use for every player.
ok. they will know it's ubuntu compat?
you can also check /msg ubotu hcl for the hardware compatibility list
thank you
nope
I didnt find it so i came here. Can i install it manually?
do you use ARM chromebook?
I dont think so. Its a hp chromebook 14
have you seen this arcticle: [URL]
no, but im gonna check it out. thanks in advance
kk worth a try hope it works out
Can not enter: # ubuntu-de (You were banned)
I can see you are named in the ban list.  talk to one of the ubuntu-de operators to work it out
I do not know who is operater I know only one can not help but disgusting out of the way that works.
the user is k1l - try #ubuntu-de-ops too.  [URL]  try #ubuntu-de-ops you seem to know what the issue is
are you sure?
yep
nope
good idea, i did that for a while and its the best thing i ever did
its kinda like a step back to the 80's but it forces you to get good
yeah, you learn the how and why, instead of just clicking stuff
getting myself back into the admin group
do you have any accounts with sudo access or have you enabled root?
strace eh. I'll try it quick. Well, I just closed bittornado and it helped a bit
I think that's what it's called - I've not tried it on ubuntu - I'm new here (48 hours new now)
DeVnOrE, how do I squeeze ANY extra speed outta it?. DeVnOrE, it just seems that the trans level is slow
i can awnswer that in the morning. at the moment i'm just comming home strom a frat-party
DeVnOrE, lol, must be nice
@ the moment i can just say that samba has alot of overherad
DeVnOrE, well, I just think it's REALY sad that this thing is transfering so slow
that's just the way samba works. guess nfs could be faster, (but less secure)
really? I thought that might not be technical enough of a question for #bash
doesn't hurt to ask there too.
hmm.. firstly It didnt find my networkcard..feisty find it dirvectly..but thats ok..its alpha and I filed a bug..I disliked the ways windows minimized and maximized but couldnt find a way to change it,,even no sound
- you mean the effect of the windows minimizing? Because you can totally change that.  - what sound card are you using?. because I am running it right now, and my sound and networking gave me no issues at all
im using intel :S I tought that was the best choice for linux
- it should pick up intel network card no problem. But like you said, it is alpha
oh you asked for my soundcard.. my wificard is dlink :)
Oh... wifi... well.. you are asking for troubles there, I think.
what you mean ? flv, thats the flash video format
not familiar with it, i guess grep is out
no, just install
sure there's only one partition? "sudo parted -l | pastebinit"
do i need to redo the install ... or can i creat a swap now ?
depends how good your partitioning skills are :)
sudo apt-get upgrade. oops. 1 1049kB 79,0GB 79,0GB primary ext4 boot. 2 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB extended. 5 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB logical linux-swap(v1)
so you do have swap. also, don't paste here
but wasnt it supposed to be like 2GB ?
nope
yeah, i know if it a big paste ill get muted. so ... i do have a swap, and its the size of the disk ?
size of the RAM
oh right, another GB
type "free -m"
ok i did .. and ?
see how it says swap and RAM?
1 1049kB 79,0GB 79,0GB primary ext4 boot. 2 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB extended. 5 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB logical linux-swap(v1)
*facepalm* please stop pasting
lol ok sorry guys :/. but .. since i have only 1gb .. shouldnt i have a bigger swap to help RAM ?
if you even go into swap it's a bad sign. just use it. hmm i don't fancy touching that conversation if you want to say that :). if you put swap on a memory card it's going to die. they are not designed to tolerate it
MrPisslz: Nope, not too sure what you're talking about. What didn't have direct rendering?. err. haha speeled your name wrong
xD.
Pisslz haha
Well when xserver starts I do glxinfo and I find out I have no DRI and no direct rendering.
I DID
no you didn't
HOLD on how would i do that
it's the solution to the problem, so if ou did it then you have sound in firefox
tx pls assist me.  i have no /etc/firefox3. but  i have /etc/firefox-3.0
[URL]
yeah!
but if you REALLY want to be admin that bad: System/Administration/Users and Groups... add yourself to the root group
it looks more like a cow.. an awesome dairy cow
it has a bar on the top of the screen (in Ubuntu), but that's about it
nope, internal broadcom
thank god. I help'd a guy earlier on the linksys usb issue..  hmm, what chipset is that broadcom
simple files, i wonder if there can be bad implications or not, like some metadata getting lost?
As a dual booter I have a share partition, for media and documents and that is it, no operating system type files..  The share is a NTFS
I'm running 1024x768
hmm. 1280x1024?. i dunno
Razor bash:sane-find-scanners:command not found
word-processing, forms of messaging, text editing, websurfing (ocasionally), music listening, etc..  did you sudo apt-get install sane?. errr, sorry!. sane-find-scanner
I got it to load torrents and they are started but no downloading
is there a utorrent irc channel
Let me check
do other torrent clients work ok under ubuntu?
This is all I've tried. It's ubuntu server
you do know that ubuntu comes with transmission in a default install...
is that what I asked?. (on Ati/Amd hardware)
I would say yes, but I take it you don't think that?
which has a specific meaning..  I didn't ask 'which class of drivers'.
Ok in that case it uses VESA which is compatible on most cards these days..  And you now earned an ignore :)
ok
bean-oh, what's so unclean about KDE?. bean-oh, i've only learned the C bindings to GTK+. bean-oh, and a small bit of Qt
sorry, meant to specify video.
ffmpeg
But which drivers? I ugraded from breezy, and nothing was broken there. now dapper freezes every 30-40 minutes
I don't know. you need to suspect something and then see if it happens if you don't load that module. check /var/log/syslog to see if it suggests anything.  are you using closed source drivers?
well, thx  I imagine it's the ati stuff. seems to have lots of bug reports in launchpad. no, I use the xorg ati driver
yeah. I guess ATI still hasn't hired a decent linux coder
yeah thats what i saiud when told about it, but thought i would make the statement for the sake of conversation
it worked for conversation :)
it's an ok file .. but tell me steps please?
it can be very messy you have to install all the devel lib first and the compilers linkers etc.  you are better finding it on the repos or on getdeb
i see .. a webpage maybe?
!b-e
Any thought why install should say "Error: Wrong architecture i386"?
what's line of processor do you have?
spellins still messed.  you are sudo-su?
yes. sorry
I've got a Zyxel ZyAir b-120 and I can't get it seem to 'find' it
okay, do you know what chipset it has?
it's got a prims chipset. purdy wide support AFAIK. prism. 2 or 2.5 methinks
when you run dmesg in the terminal is there any mention of it?
just a sec
apparently its actually a zydas zd1201.  [URL]
no, it's fine. I just don't really have any desire for 3d effects and such..  mostly I just wanted to play around with it
it's easy to get running on your hardware, you were just given bad advice
how do you mean?
do you have compiz installed?
yea. and emerald.
enable it, install ccsm, then have fun AND GET RID OF THAT EMERALD CRAp. like I said ages ago
mac command prompt?.  mac os.  ubuntu on another ssh end.  with screen
not sure, ctrl+pgup maybe..
doesn't work
or just pgup or shift+pgup...you get the idea
how abt k7/k8 processors?
It should work on those, but it does NOT work on, eg, my Palm PDA.
ah ok thanks.  thanks
yw
i checked everything and all audio levels are at the top.  and un-muted
not the audio levels, you should be able to click on a tab that is called switches and the turn "ispeaker" on
i checked switchs but i dont see an option to turn on "ispeaker" . i checked the prefrences and i didnt see ispeaker there either.
oh ok, I thought it came default with every ubuntu
no :( anyother ideas?
did you try looking in the forums?. what kind of speakers do you have?
not sure about the speakers, they work in windows. but linux cant get them to work.
type "aplay -l" in terminal. what do you see?
thanks ap
and support and discussion is in #ubuntu+1
ap - thanks just wanted to know if it was there --
its cool :)
system wide.  [URL]
what are you showing me. what command
Im looking for xchat icon.. is that in themes?
depends if its included in the themes icon set
Im just looking for the basic icoms
then I suspect it will be in the theme file. files
?
have u installed virtualbox?.  it creates a virtual ethernet interface called vboxnet0, on your host OS
i created but i delet the virtual box os
but u still have virtualbox installed right?
kezzer: rubbish, you can fix this :) sudo apt-get install gdm
I did that, it said gdm is already the latest version then it configured kdm =X
kezzer: ok there's a way to fix up installed packages using apt but i cannot remember the exact way of doing this
surely it'd be easier for me to reinstall Ubuntu?
k, givin it a shot.
make sure your winders box has DNS set properly. mmm leechers
thank Dr. Also, is there any risk running chromium?
its a well known and supported browser.
and how do you classify them?
tech11: you did install all the needed -dev packages?
Ok, ty.
i use one i got all suped up with addblocks and stuff for normal browsing. ;) then one without the stuff for watching hulu and crunchyroll basically
how do you get to talk me the way you do (showing my nickname after what you say and also your name turns red)??
thats your irc client doing it..  it just flags your own nick. My name is not red here. ;)
oh, lel, tyvm :D. yes, indeed, haha. and which broswer do you use for each?. sounds like a very good idea, btw
ff has better support for adblocks and flash downloaders
so you would do it too?
yes, I never can remember the proper way..  but you can also rename the Sxxxx file to Kxxxx, that's a little bit more proper.
personal info manager (addresses, emails, phone #s, IM nicks, etc.)
sampa i set all that in evolution which is a mail client too. mail server sorry soo sleepy by now
yeah, it will've.  i've had to change the boot device order.  i presume i fix with a livecd then?
is there a bootloader installed on your bootdevice?
what do you mean?.  grub boots as far as stage 1.5
update grub, then
could you pastebin your config file? i accidentally deleted it and its nearly impossible to find one, and apt-get doesn't replace it
: sudo apt-get --purge apache
cool. let me try that
: that should remove it completely. then sudo apt-get install apache
it doesnt work with the mouse and when i try to go back to normal it messes up my screen and then i need to restart to fix it
! xrandr, not just randr. I believe they have different effects
ok. ok so im using xranr but its stll not working. xrandr*. sweden?
! So it rotates the screen but the mouse axis doesn't change?
whats power applet?
a battery icon on your panel...?
that'll compile the drivers again?
no that'll tell us if it's available. or loaded
root@tails:~ # modprobe nvidia. FATAL: Module nvidia not found.. It's not ;)
okay...  do you still have the installer?
I wanted to do it the 'debian-way', but if that won't work I'll use the one from [URL].  Isn't it apt-get'able ?
I believe so.  i believe os. so*
I don't remember if I used apt-get or the nvidia-installer when I setup that box. Now I just changed the kernel, and the module can't be found (like duh :P).
you could manually place the files where they belong..  do a 'locate nvidia' and copy everything from the old kernel dir, into the new one, and edit the config files it made.  but I'm really sorry, I dont have time right now, I've got a kernel I have to test and bug-fix. :-D. later all
.. nah, I'll try the installer from [URL] first. :).  OK, well thank you for your time :)
sorry i couldn't give more, if i did the kernel right, i'll be right back. :-D
just atnt on an android phone
maybe we should all switch to android phones ... cause i never hear you complaining about problems ;)
heard what?
the desktop install has X and a lot of other stuff...
oh.. so i do sudo mkdir darkx before?
there must be a /mnt folder. mount it there
I have just seen it, but i think it has no gui
that's right. gocr has a gui, I think -- but it's not as good recognition-wise (unless it's made progress in the last couple of years)
gocr is unreadable :(
what do you mean -- is the recognition insufficient?
p|.c |'dl l( un>Elc <lue cl ()ji\'rn CilT\Cl\liU o lllcln fl\ \|. that's it
have you got a license for closed source OCR?
in any case, it doesn't matter what glxgears says -- if it shows you have glx working, great. but that's it..  i stand corrected
:D I thought you might.
Screen? Please elaborate.
search for 'GNU Screen'
thats it...ty
er.. if its the latest, there's no menu.lst ;p
I will check that
if you don;t know, then you don't have it
empty :S any other ideas?
nope, sorry
ok thanks anyway
what program is supposed to be doing the mounting?
truecrypt, are you familiar with it?
I'm not really, but I guess I'd just recommend taking a look at their documentation if you haven't.
nethack isn't the same kind of text based game.
BLASPHEMY
interesting, i've heard of some problems with tray icons showing up in unity, will have to investigate further
i am not missing any icons (steam, hplib, skype) so there is nothing hidden by default
[URL] maybe those applications whitelist themselves, or maybe i'm misunderstanding
ah ok, didnt know that, thanks for the link.  as you see skype and hp-systray are in there, because of that i am not missing them :)
looks like the answer to my own question is yes, also looks like skype is one of those that is whitelisted by default. i have an application that lives mostly in the tray, looks like i'll need to make it whitelist itself under unity
i think so to
yeah. i think, i dunno. i need to get gcc
'sudo dpkg -i [URL]b'
i'm a linux install newbie. ok
just a min ute
that's what I thought
and select edit menu
sound works great : system / xmms amarok
: gxine packs? are they old or beta?
: how can I tell?
: look at the version of gxine; go through its website and look at the latest packs.  : also try to close all "giving sound applications" and try gxine
methods yap
works great for me
mhallll9 - I'm not sure that's why I'm askin
I don't think it is. at least not on any version of Lotus I've ever had the misfortune of using
there isnt. I made the updates,but im still on the same v.
itll let u just delete the other partion and resize ur current one to the full width..
sor, once you get it working* sorry
I set up my network settings, and they are erased after reboot.  I have it working, I just have to do it manually. I can't get it to auto-do wtf I need it to
sor, are you trying to connect to your home wireless?
No, I'm trying to get ubuntu to do that on startup. I can do it, ubuntu is having trouble it seems
i'm here for the same thing. there is a file you have to edit
What is your problem, maybe I can help
the bad part for me is that I CAN connect automatically.... but its to my neighbors. LOL
Oh well in that case, good luck
It's disappeared, and I want to kill it and restart so I can moniter it
Try ALT+TABing to it? CTRL+ALT+(Directional Key) to another desktop?.  Bad idea.
it hasn
That may cause broken packages. Are you in the middle of a dist-upgrade?
yes
If packages havn't been installed yet, you can just killall update-manager
what can I do ?
that usually means that the disk is larger than your BIOS can handle, according to the documentation.  you could look for an update to your BIOS, use a smaller disk, or install on a partition closer to the beginning of the disk
this box had gentoo installed without problems.. i'm just testing ubuntu.. it's on the first partition.
which boot loader are you currently using?
grub. i just installed ubuntu. it didn't ask me anything. i'll see if it comes with lilo.
what were you using before?
lilo
you could try installing lilo, then
thanks, I will.
you are given a choice in the expert install, but you could just as easily run the lilo installer from gentoo, if you're comfortable with that
My Desktop
what model
I put together it myself. It has a ASUS P5GD2 deluxe mother board
ah :), there is possibly a part causing ubuntu not to shutdown properly, similar to the asus eeepc 701 and the intel sound. The only way (I know of) is to google each parts for issues with linux
i have tried that countless times. and failed miserably
well i can't help there
there is no system group
why not? it must be per default in upper left corner. you have modified it?.  run gnome-font-properties, then. stone cold jesus il also aa song by Ovekill. Overkill*. :D. I like metal
I tried it and it returned nothing...
hrm, then it may not be packaged or spelled that way
i cant install the realplyer
did you try installing it from apt-get/synaptic or manually?
what do i do. just extract it regularly?
extract it, and ./configure, make, make install, but sometimes they want other stuff on and that.
how do i make isntalll. i need to make install how do i do that
what are you trying to install?
what do i type, im trying to install monotorrent
sometimes or a lot of the time, they even have instructions in the tar.gz as to how to install it
I get no sound
energy: through headphones or speakers
Speakers
energy: headphones ok?
that was fast are you sure
Absolutely positive. Unless you re-write the software to not use the packages it needs it's impossible.
well can i force 2 packages to install that would normally remove each other. for example gnome-games and same gnome
Well what package do you want to tweak (and what dependencies) ?
the same-gnome package was removed from the repos, i found it in the januty repos, but it wont insytall without removing gnome-games on lucid is there a way around this
Are you mixing repos and versions? What version are you running?
yep
cool had ti ask is all. ;). to*
okay, the strange thing is that it's worked before using the same procedure
Yeah, I saw that, another release?
perhaps I should check on that
I meant another ubuntu release.
uh, as shown here: [URL]  you type in the name of the command that's installed by another package, and you are told what you need to install to run it
oh. hrm. yeah that is useful. your installation isn't doing that?.  try dpkg -L command-not-found ... that package is installed?
I have proble with compiling linux streams
why are you compiling software
ok.
The drop down the little drop down box and select "All available applications", and search 'compiz'.  Then install Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm).  Once it is finished installing, you can find it under System | Preferences | Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
oh wait. that's already there. - Advanced desktop settings. I think that used to be "custom" under appearances.
It has everything you could possibly want in it
any workaround?
use totem or gnome-mplayer plugin
plus any way to play divx videos in firefox?.  hmmm, lemme search
install restricted extras. !es | a
no way getting some of the plugins for mplayer java flash etc
!tell  about restriced formats.  read ubotu's message. !tell  about restricted formats
ok.  managed=false looks not right. Any idea where I can find what process changed that, and when and why ?
items listed in nm-applets drop down menu are text files contained at /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*
no shell, home directory. I use it for a samba user
do you currently get a drop down list of normal users?
just going to try that now, i may just install an old version and upgrade, same thing right?
in theory, yes that's the same.  ymmv, and all that
hmm, 9.10 boots. ill install that, then is it best to just do an upgrade from the update manager or?
may want to try 10.04, since upgrading may not work as planned
how come?
too big of a version jump, IMO. It may work, I just don't like to skip releases.
dunno how ill do it, any reason it didnt work downloading and burning to dvd(10.10 i mean)
did you check the md5/sha1 sum of the DVD ISO?
yeah but the ubuntu site doesnt mention burning to dvd, only cd, so could that be the prob?
is there a separate DVD ISO? If not, it probably doesn't work because you've used a DVD
fallen: but when I tru su and it won't accept my password. *try
the live cd has own passwords
thx,
you could also try sudo apt-cache search dvd ripper ...or even try synaptic.
router logs. never turned the service on
Is it: /var/log/auth.log ?
dont' recall
sudo service ssh status; sudo netstat -tulp (to be sure)
i an certain there was an ssh login despite the service never turned on
How can you be? /var/log/auth.log contains all logins, also last and lastlog
concerned as a google search says that non-continguous whould never be over 1 - 2%
well, i'll tell you not to worry. ;)
already installed....
Okay, then you should be able to install the package like normally
can't - says i386 error or something. Unless I do it via terminal... that was through software center
Hm... I'm not too sure.
trying terminal now.  [URL] bummer.
That's not really how you install a deb package, use "sudo gdebi [URL]b"
oh. :(.  it's sort of always worked for me. *shrug*
(gdebi may not come by default, you should apt-get install it).  It works... When you already satisfied all the dependencies of the package.  Otherwise use gdebi
k, installing now.  it failed but I need to do an apt-get -f install... 726MB worth, yet my root partition is down to 500MB free. Nice.
Ouch :/
yep, I thought 15GB was enough for root. No idea where the space is coming from. I can onlya llocate about 7GB in use..  This package is uninstallable Cannot install 'gksu:i386' . WOOP!
Eh... :/
well the pidgin wont let me recieve pictures from another persons yahoo messenger.  do you know how to fix problems with pidgin
depends on the problem.
every time I try to recieve a picture from my friend using yahoo messenger it says she has canceled the file sharing when she hasn't
yeah, filesharing has always been buggy in the third party clients. Try posting it an image bin and using that instead.
I'm new to linux what is and image bin?. and*. an*
it's a website that lets you post images.  like flickr, picasa, etc.
ahh okay
or try this... (hold on)
I've tried that and apt-get -f install, both failed.  I've written it all here: [URL]
Okay.
did it improve anything?
for one computer, i didn;t notice any difference, but for the other, well i made too many changes to know how much differnece the wubi-to-native change made, but that machine is much happier now.  wubi->ext4, gnome->bare openbox, samba shares->nfs shares, and it went from 100% cpu playing SD video in boxee and HD not being playtable at all to <20% cpu playing some 720p (cartoons, mainly) and <80% on others
really?
you can backup, and do a clean install. But why not try to fix the upgrade?
I guess I could do that. All I have is 10.04 LiveCD on a USB drive.
come to +1
oh. that sux :(
it was completely phased out when xfree86 version 4.0 came out.
so gotta use vesa drivers :/
yup. i havent seen a C&T graphics chip in. ....... over a decade.
I searched in [URL] for that file but got the answer that it could not be found for Gutsy..  Yes, I do just mean that.
right, dpkg -S gnome-system-tools.po found nothing too .. it was probably generated on the fly by some package's installer
i did hostserv. but no help there
There is no hostserv here. You need to ask in #freenode
Just authoring some web pages, javascript
sorry, I should just go to sleep
web development sorry
vim!
- yea I will try the auto button on the monitor but if that doesnt work.. what would be my option?
let me guess.. this is a CRT monitor?
- nope its LCD but its old and a weird make
Try the xrandr tools and xvidtune. could be the refresh rate is wrong also. but that would be weird.
I want to make my own cloud network
have you tried owncloud?
More which programs they used and so on.  No, is it good?
i know a few peopl ewho use it.  check it out, might fit your needs
i got the ubuntu-restrited-extras pack
which package did you install after that
erm, dunno, the one totem suggested
try installing w32codecs or th gstreamer. from synaptic package manager
I mean in a script
same thing, as you type it on the commandline, is how you can put it in the script
i never knew there was problem - always thought was myth
few years ago when i was looking for mp3 player it was some problem
and it has tons of stuff
isn't it 1.5 GB?. once installed?
it seemed smaller to me
everyone here has told me it's 1.5 GB
it's the default one :-/
whats the default theme? Mine imported most of the setting I had from warty.
it's the "human" theme. same as in warty... cept for this change
Oh the browns. LOL
i mean, i know i can change the theme, but it's problematic as the default. lol, yeah, i like them actually :-)
I thought the 'Lush' theme is pretty nice.
oh weird....  i just changed out of human and back to it... and i have my selection colours back
Did you happen to custom your old one?
not at all
hmm no idea.. But atleast you got them back right?
I'm trying to install python-qt, but it requires libc6 2.5 or higher. I have 2.4
python-qt3 and python-qt4 are in ubuntu's repositories and will work with the installed libc6.  what are you running?
trying to install a program called Anki on this Edgy. or run it
well you might want to try edgy's python-qt
OK. what the heck. I just went into terminal on F1... came back, and the display is fine.
restarting x is usualy the right way to do it , crtl _ alt _ backspace
hrm - what does that sound like? I ctrl-alt-f1, and back, and screen is ok.... \o/ and all, but I am still scared....
rico_, ask in #compiz-fusion
so that's all there is to it?
well, can you communicate with a japanese dude in native language ? :)
are u doing ALSA>PulseAudio>ALSA or ALSA>PulseAudio>ESD?
alsa->PA->alsa, no ESD
Linux tar has gzip buildin, or you can gzip -cd <file> | tar xvf -
interesting (the stuff you learn in irc is amazing)
hence tar zxvf means unzip, extract, be verbose, this file
hmmm
how do I do that?. where is it located?
usually /etc/ssh/ssh{d}_conf
I mean Wireless USB adapters
Oh. Anyone got the fglrx drivers working on any ATI card?
OK, thanks. Do you know if it also takes kare of the wireless app?
that i don't
when I do updates will it take longer?
yes as you have more packages to upgrade
because after that, you have to specify paths to languages, etc.  lots of shell script commands
just paths to commands to run, not languages.  you just put the command and whatever arguments
ok, I'll give it another try
and use the full path to the command because it won't be run with your regular login shell environment
how to check it ? I think it's English(India) under Tool > Language > For Selection in Libreoffice
It doesnt seem like there are any hunspell packages for en-in
It's still not working after installing hunspell packages
If you change the document language to en-Us ?
After changing to en-US it's still not working.
hmmm
awesome, cheers man.  do i just put that after the command?
yes
i just tried 'find / -name *.png | grep pid 2> /dev/null' and got error outputs. is that the correct syntax?
your redirecting grep, not find there. you're
hmm ok.  because I know somebody who has problems with compiz right now...
whats the problem?
freezes and window closing
can you pastebin the output of lspci command? to see what video chipset you have?
is there a command line tool that does that?. out of interest
!info hexdump. !info hd.  what is the output of: cat /etc/issue
Iv got a a cut down version of 12.04
what does the text say please
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS \n \l
seems to be in bsdmainutils package.  [URL]
there are plenty
gimpshop is very hard to compile
(loaded in tray is ubuntu 9.04 i386 desktop. hehe, i'm afraid it's a hybrid problem hehe
the ubuntu cd follows the cd standard.. if xp can't read it either the cd or XP is broken
slart: thanks, i'll try another computer :)
do that.. also you can boot from the cd and run the cd test
Yea, I just installed it. Leme take a look.
it will be like the second icon down on the left side. and then the 3rd or 4th button on the right. id say go through each section to familiarize yourself with the options then decide what you want to do hehe
I now have a dump of my configurations
does it show any errors ?
none are listed
also you are starting it under root or using sudo right ?
uh...that was a test...you passed....  man i feel dumb, thanks heaps
heh man no worries :)
thx v much.  just cat them all together
could you give me the command for that? Sorry, I'm still picking it all up.
you running hardy?
Yes.
i don't have page up or page down keys, which is why I'm asking for other methods of producing these keys, when in terminal
but a ppa is not supported here
heres the link to test [URL]
Looks like there are some instructions there
ook ty
Let me know if that doesn't work
been awake since yesterday trying to fix my desktop
any one of them
dbus restarted successfully, still no joy on the mounting front
hmmm.  try a reinstall of HAL
~ didnt i already do that?
I don't know, did you?
thanks.. but many software can't be used on 64bit..
the only problem I've had with 64-bit was java, and I fixed that by using a 32-bit build of firefox
now apt-get alsa-base
It's already the latest version.
oh right.. install alsa-utils from synaptic instead
It's already installed
ok..... another moment.  are u able to run alsaconf?
Yes
did it spit out anything?
When I first ran it?
no. this time
modinfo: could not find module snd. then it goes into the config.
then make the changes in the config that u think is necessary
like what =/
not really sure. had i known, we could have done this like 15 mins ago.. sorry man
Following card(s) are found on your system: hda-intel (the nVidia), legacy probe-legacy isa (non-pNp) chips. Last time I went with the nvidia, should I try the pnp this time just to see if it'll work?
yep
Still nothing :(
turn it back then
back to the nvidia? done.
i officially ran out of ideas
Well,  if we can't do this..
and i can put songs on my ipod iwth it?
that i dont know, dont like ipdos
ok so i put that full line in fstab under default?
[URL]
thanks
I think that might be a bit out of date tho
ok so that link i posted mentions upgrading to later versions of a few sane related pacakges to resolve this issue. but i cannot find them on the debian site. any thoughts on how to get them. or how to address this scanner issue?
Ahh, I see you're just trying to downgrade a single package. That's still not supported, and still probably won't work, but less doom-and gloomy :).  To be clear, your scanner works in Ubuntu 14.04 but not on Ubuntu 16.04?
yup. well. mint 17.3. works in it
Can you test from an Ubuntu 17.04 LiveUSB?
Doc: how much?
$350 or just a tad under.. same price as i found on the internet.. actually lower then some websites by $10-20
yup
Please do.
i did but synpatic continues with BIG fonts
did you try logging out/back in?
i wanna compile with it. what package i need?
try 'which <executablename>'. issit in your $PATH?
what is the cleanest way? I have ccsm installed
What is a good MP3 player for compatibility with Ubuntu and free formats like Ogg and FLAC?.  Go in your desktop effects menu and disable the desktop effects there. Your desktop will automatically revert to Metacity..  System -> Preferences -> Appearance, Desktop Effects
desktop effects menu brings up ccsm I think
Bring up the Visual Effects menu under Appearance.
aaah ok  that worked, I was using the advanced effects menu item
Now try Blender again and see if it's fixed.
oh noes. still crashes
Well, it's probably not a problem with Compiz then.
- restricted mgr?
are you on gnome and feisty?
kubuntu
then install nvidia-glx-new. that's the best
OK, esd is running, any other ideas?
I mentioned about 20 minutes ago that you could try: esddsp $game.  (substitute $game for the executable name)
iwlist -a <<--- there is nos such options. ifconfig -a doesnt detect it
woops. seems like the card isn't being detected anyway
lspci detects it
what card?
wifi card.  broadcom.. bcm4311
followed this? [URL]
cause i read some paper on the web and is a little bit "strange". for example if i understanding well, u can read some file with SU without the super user power. is a little bit strange how i explain that. but i think this is the thing
start at the beginning, what do you wish to accomplish
i'm not a beginner, for u a beginner try to study some hard things about file perms?
you're not making much sense
i just wanna study how linux use the perms for rwx. that's it
[URL]
I did. all seems well there
Anyone planning on fixing the horrendously miserable Wacom tablet calibration program? After every 2nd tap, "Misclick detected, restarting..."
I don't see anything there related to the mouse though. only the pen, which seems to be fine
What kind of Wacom tablet is this?
what do you mean?
it's taken the same line as first founfdin 10.04 netbook. the panel is not for us plebs!. *found in.  there's way around some missing add-ons; e.g. xpad instead of note, docky can do some others... but I miss the panel apps being available... most annoying other panel miss is no weather option for date/time
ah thanks
You can press alt+ctrl+f2 and get a shell, but of course no services would be installed etc.  why, what prohibits you from installing even just on a file or on a vm?
in this case the machine in question has no permanent storage whatsoever
you can use a VM in ram
so wat i need to do fr keeping it in that range i mean 192. something
configure network as bridge and not as nat
ohh thankx i will check once :).  i configured network as attached to bridged and name = eth0 still its showing 10. something
your xp guest is using dhcp?
i dont know :(. how to check it?
check on windows network settings
where exactly in internet properties?
in connection details
yes, I'm doing sudo apt-get install startupmanager, and it says there are references to it but it says it's not available and has no install candidate. and it doesn't work in the software center either, even though it shows up when i search for it
not sure. does apt-cache search startupmanager show it
it doesn't show anything
im not sure. have you tried apt-get update first
I did, but now that you mention it it does say "W: Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/[URL]_ubuntu_dists_oneiric_universe_binary-amd64_Packages Hash Sum mismatch. ".  when I run apt-get update, i mean
try a different mirror maybe
i'm not quite sure how to try it with a different mirror
i think its under software sources - mirrors. dropdown box
I will then use kernel module switching?
you should be able to install the non-free driver, which will enable 3d acceleration
I also think it's buggy, but Sony don't have a BIOS update. There's a way I can powerdown it with APM under Ubuntu (that ROCKS big time!)?
type: lsmod|grep apm.  in a terminal
Ogra: I don't have any APM module loaded :(
sudo modprobe spm
I got an error when modprobing :(
sudo modprobe apm
PA-A1-OC3MM. Opps.. FATAL: Error inserting apm (/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-2-386/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/apm.ko): No such device
how is you bios set up ?
Ogra: like all Phoneix custom Sony BIOSes, you just can't do nothing but boot order :(
i can set up several things for PM in mine
Ogra, no way. Anyway I can reboot to double check things.. but without changing anything, with a cute Slackware 10 install, I could swithoff the laptop with 'powerdown'.
i can select acpi on/off
Ogra, I reboot and check. Back later. UBUNTU ROCKS! FINNALLY A LINUX DISTRIBUTION THAT ROCKS!
yeah !!
yes , partition. i can see the partitions on the primary sata controller. but not on the secondary
[URL] Sorry. Stupid phone browser
;:)
Top link
i was asking myself why :))
the psychocats link is great
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root
ls -l $(readlink -f /bin/sh)
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 871932 Dec 12 11:49 /bin/[URL]sh.  what we really wanna do there?
hmm looks good
what?
we're trying to see the permissions of the file that's getting executed
one thing i wanna know, why I can access using SSH, but not machine own terminal
when you access via ssh you mean using the root account?. im not that clear on what you meant, thought you meant you can login as root, but from the user you get /bin/sh permission denied. even as root from the tty you just get a permission denied /bin/sh?
both ways I try to login as root, as it is the only user available now, but on machine I can't login, but I can login from other machine's terminal using SHH.  are you getting me, what I wanna say?
yeah.  what happens if from ssh you try "sudo login root" and try to login. or just "login root"
yeah now it has problem <unable to get valid context for root>. <cannot make/remove an entry for the specific session>
no idea, seems like some pam stuff, try asking in ##Linux
can you tell me, is it some thing related to permission of "sh". I want to figure out the difference of SSH and non-SSH way,
the permissions look fine.  it might be something related to pam authentication and stuff like that
pam authentication?? actually this is SELinux, any new idea?
nope, try asking in ##linux. try to md5sum the file see if its right. it is a .rar archive right?
How does it populate then?
use unitytweak or [URL]
I've build a custom ubuntu with all my stuff in it, but when installing my home folders get flushed, meaninf all the alacarte settings are gone. i could back it up into my dotfiles-repo but yeah, would be neat to just tell the installation to use that file
"when installing my home folders get flushed" ... custom ubuntu ?
yeah I just installed all the packages i want into an ordinary ubuntu 15.04 installation and created a setup file with distroshare. now everytime i use that distro i get all the programs i want rom the beginning. *from
Oh, can't help you there, so you found the cause.
it couldn't find anything on unmount in the manual which was odd
what do you mean? oh. it is called "umount", not "unmount" - if that was what you meant
doh, apologies =)
common mistake - its a wonder its not called "unmount", actually.
ok, thx
The following might free up disk space: apt-get autoclean.  But it removes any downloaded .dpkgs
i was just using tar cf home.tar /home/me. and it couldnt copy some .secure stuff. etc
you must have copied/created some stuff as root in there.  run the tar with sudo, or find out which files are not owned by your user and why
but I do like the global appmenu
what is Ubuntu version ?
i'd be happy if the launcher was at the bottom but I understand that in 12.04 you can't do it anymore (64bit)
you are on 12.04 ? did I read that right ?
yes
then use Unity 2d and comment out the Loader in Shell.qml let me know if you need more explaining
did you use it while running linux or you just boot to the live cd and create an image. I want to use it while im running my linux system.
i did it both ways, but the live CD nowadays is so much easier i just did it with the live CD, I boot up to the live CD, get a graphical interface, connect my USB drive, then fire up gparted.  i meant to say, fired up partimage
good u clarify the gparted from partimage.hehe. im a little bit confused there.. by the way have u try it in inside the linux system. or the command [URL]eating an image.
partimage has like a little somewhat GUI menu, it should be straight forward though, just make sure you know which partition is getting imaged and which partition is going to receive the back up, you dont want to mess those two up or youll have tragic consequences
I planning to try it inside my running linux machine. i thought i won't work creating a image in inside a running machine.  I planning to try it inside my running linux machine. i thought i won't work creating a image in inside a running machine
make sure the partition isnt mounted though.  i backed up my windows partition from inside linux, i suggest you use a live CD though
So its ok to run partimage inside a running linux machine even though the one i create or the source i want to create a image i the one running.
again -- the partition youre going to work on needs to be unmounted -- but since you dont know what that means im going to tell you the safest thing to do --- from within linux it doesnt work(you can do it and prove me wrong) -- use a live CD
thanks you very much..may i ask again do you know similar to partimage that work inside a running linux by creating an image..i mean creating a image from a running linux machine..hope you know something alike.  creating an image in which the source is the running linux machine with out umounting it. or you dont want to boot to live cd. to run it.
i heard of others but partimage is the one I tried and it worked, didnt bother testing the other ones, I suggest you use a live CD though, if you have questions about using a live CD go ahead and ask, live CD is the way to go
but, if i shutdown network-manager, i lose connectivity. so i shoud try to shutdown dhcbd as well then?
then reconnect manually -- you can't mix the two thigns
does avidemux works with x264 ?
it does =)
hmm. anyone else can validate rug?. is there anyway to look at my wireless adapters settings and maybe perform some tweaks(O/P power , Rx Sens etc)?. is there anyway to look at my wireless adapters settings and maybe perform some tweaks(O/P power , Rx Sens etc)?
Interesting problem; I have been able to watch DVD's for a long time. I just installed VMWare server and now I cannot play any DVD's. Any suggestions?
I can't find it
same as all the other source
so you have to specify what package to update then?
update juts updated the [URL]st
i just need a standard library with basic apps.  i folowed this guide here: [URL]  but i coudn't get anything to work after that
Sorry, I don't have the time to really help you at the moment, i'm off to bed, sorry.
Go to your room, young man.
stop
sudo? or admin priviledges?.  That might explain.... synclient not installed.....
you don't need sudo for using that command.  its provided by this package. sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics. install it, restart and try to enable touchpad with the command i gave you
synaptics driver not loaded? is it normal for ubuntu not to install packages needed for hardware?
Not its not, something might have been broken during upgrade. This is why i never ever ever upgrade and spend a little bit of time backing up stuff and do a clean install instead
umm how do i figure this out? I have an inspiron 1521 w/ whatever came with it
run "lspci" in an terminal
where in lspci is it?
"lspci | grep VGA"
yes
did you set up port forwarding in your router? you have to
ummm no, it wasn't stated anywhere, can you refer me to what should I do exactly?
google for 'how to set up port forwarding in router'
yeah, but which port should I forward?.  O'.  I'm using bridged adapter, not NAT
[URL]
it's relevant to NAT, I'm using a bridged adapter
did you check that you aren't using an IP already used on the network?
yeah
is the gateway correct? tried with 192.168.0.1?
and the ubuntu wiki says that it is unable to play them..  well, no. :P
IMHO you 'need' to boycott such filth ;)
some sites don't have an alternative. like mediazone
so don't visit them.  and/or complain to them that you are unable to view their broken media files ;)
but then I would have to go without my beloved Rugby.  well, luckily they DO say that they know the problem exists
video files of sport are DRM'd? wtf?
and they are looking for a way to support alternative OS's
that's good news
I don't know why, either.. ><
sounds like they're trying
yes, but this is their advice: Please check back periodically and make your wishes known with Apple and Microsoft..  they also mention linux, just not in that sentence.
buck passing, sounds like
there must be some type of hack which allows me to watch it ><.  they also say this: (MediaZone currently supports only Windows Media Player, but other media formats will be supported soon).
I doubt MS is forcing them to use drm
here's hoping.....  yeah, why would they use drm? are there any advantages?
suggest they use xvid, which is an open standard and supported by OSS ;).  are you sure it's drm rather than just a proprietary codec?
pretty sure. look: Regrettably at this time, you cannot watch MediaZone's live events or other entertainment using the Macintosh or Linux operating systems due to Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) lack of support for these operating systems.
of course neither MS nor apple media players will play xvid outta the box ;)
thank you, I figured that was all i needed. I also add elevator=noop to /etc/default/grub. I definately don't want cfq on an SSD
what is this elevator stuff?.  ah read some stuff. it means that requests are directly handled by the ssd itself.  will do a speed comparison
aren't they modules?
yeah, they can be (and usually are) compiled as modules-- but they are distributed with the kernel in most cases.  what drivers did you want to back up?
basically the ones I currently have on my Ubuntu install of 10.04
there's no need to do that. unless you have proprietary drivers for weird devices, all future kernels will support what it supports today. for the most part
"for the most part", I remember I had to download a driver when I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
you mean nvidia/graphic card drivers?
a wifi driver
in that case what you'll need is the driver source code, not the compiled modules. The compiled modules will almost certainly not work with other kernels
what?
!offtopic >
I'll try no, then. selecting keyboard... XKB set shuold be left alone, right?
correct
will do
might want to tab a couples of times. woops!

spammage!
would that be alright to run a dual boot?
yep
great. thanks
Step one: defrag
how did it go for you?
fares better than esd on this machine but certain doesn't work across all arches.
thanks
you can use wicd, it has wicd-curses which is a nice text gui for wifi
nope. everything is here. it makes no sense
./ means "in the current directory" so check with "ls ." that they're actually there
yes those are the instructions I used to install ff1.5
some programs, you'll need to specify the path to firefox, it's a case by case analysis
I am using lucid, and it recognized it right off the bad.. *bat
as what?
an ipod touch
Fascinating. Using what program?
dj_seffault1, I can browse the files using nautilus, but it just shows up as a device in rhythmbox and I can see all of my music...I can even play some of it on my laptop....but it has really screwed up my touch now cause it says no music on it.
So it sees it as an external USB storage device, but not a music player. Sorry to hear your music got messed up. Hope you had it backed up.
I'm not so sure it sees it as just an external usb mass storage...why else would it show up in rhythmbox?.  the music is still on the device, for some reason it isn't recognizing it though.
If you put MP3 files on a thumbdrive you can play them from rhythmbox too.
What do you mean by "just search"?
well, in most apps you can search inside a file for stuff.  just open the file in a texteditor that can, if this is a textfile which I assume
Excellent! I am speaking about a program and not a file.
okay, then what program? or is the program called ".config".  or am I tlaking to the wrong person here? (goes checking)
The program's name is '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration'. I have clearly stated that in my question at the outset.
hehe, you don't expect me to know the name of every program ever written, do you? To me that seems like the .config file for a kernel. Anyhows, good luck ;)
Enjoy Ubuntu!
yeah.. That I am.
oh ok
I had to write some short scripts and add them to a panel to control rhythmbox while it is minimized
are there any other media players that support applets
xmms
hmm ok, any idea how to stop it doing that?
do you only want console?
I am trying to reencode to mp4, which works on my work laptop. but the same command doesn't work on my home computer
with mencoder?
its fine, so I run that command after I boot into the live CD?
YOU UBUNTU SYSTEM IS NOT YET INSTALLED ?. oops
it is
sorry for the caps
i had to fix a hal.dll error on my windows hard drive. and now it won't let me choose what operating system to boot into. it goes straight to windows
then just boot in it and update_grub from your ubuntu
i can't, even if i force the computer to look at that hard drive
i think id would do it
it gives me an error
could you c/p the error ?
geeek, filesystem errors, yes. any of you use badblocks to check for bad sectors in linux ... even on ntfs systems?
i would recommened using windows tool for ntfs :d
I think so... I hope there is nothing I need to "enable".  I mean, I am trying compiz. and it seems like it's work. errr working ;)
is compiz actually working ?
yah
if so, then glx enabled and you're good to go
thinking c, c++, but i'm fluent in python
for c and c++ 'apt-get install build-essential' would get you the basics installed.  outside of that, google is your friend - there is a lot of stuff on blogs out there for specific languages/environments
thank you sir
glad to help - hope that gets you started at least :-)
when it's installed, where are the help docs stored? /usr/share?
ha, not really sure - never went looking for them :-/
ok
the widgets arent worth it in my opinion and if you are annoyed by them remove em
i mostly wanted to find out what it was
keep looking at the options in screenlet manager and see if you can hide it in notification bar but i couldnt find it when I was using them
yes, but hiding it isn't the same as shutting it down. and it's still running...
oh. yeah you have to remove the entries from the sessions menu in admin prefs
I tried to read the 'find' man page, but couldn't find anything useful for the purpose
search for "not".  and "-iname".  if you used zsh, you could do something like **/^*.mp3(.) :)
got it: -type f -not -iname "*.mp3"
yes
i knew that...i was hoping to hear an intelligent, dissenting opinion. hehe :D
I have the Eee and XP runs modestly at best.  I have 2GB
you actually ran virtualbox in it?
rarely
yeah but it's in there?
XP. lowlycoder, btw [URL] !MacTel. shucks
5006EG wireless
are you sure?.. there's been some detection issues w/ that device, it gets dtected as ar5006EG, Ar5007EG and AR242x
indy: ah yes ok.. i could try getting anotther windows driver for it and see what happens then
how does lspci identify your wireless device
Indy: Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5006EG 802.11 b/g Wireless PCI Express Adapter (rev 01)
what version of ubuntu are you using
7.04 as far as i know, the G one
open a terminal and type this w/o quotes.. "lsb_release -a" (thats a lowercase L)
It's 7.10, gutsy
i can help you get that device working... but we'll have to priv. chat, cuz i'll need to rapidshare you some files
Ok, just let me know how.
type this w/o quotes.. "/join #indygunfreak"
how?
You can do it with luks encryption
Tried that, but still didn't have the option in gnom e
So that it has that in there, you'll see the correct format once you go in
